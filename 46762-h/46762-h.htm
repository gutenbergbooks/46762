<i>JENNIE'S HOME.</i></h2>

</span>
orher," said little Jennie Richards,
"isn't it 'most time for farher to be
home?"</p>

<p>"Almost time, Jennie," answered Mrs.
Richards, looking up from the face of the
baby upon her lap to the clock upon the mantel-piece.
A very pale, tiny face it was; so
tiny that Sergeant Richards used to say he
had to look twice to be sure there was any
face there; and that of the mother which bent
above it was almost as pale,&mdash;sick, anxious,
and worn; but it brightened, as she answered
Jennie. "It is five minutes before six; he
will be here very soon now."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>Away ran Jennie to the corner, where stood
a cane-seated rocking-chair, and after a good
deal of pushing and pulling, succeeded in
drawing it up in front of the stove; then to
a closet, from which she brought a pair of carpet
slippers, which were placed before the
chair.</p>

<p>"I wish I was big enough to reach farher's
coat and put it over his chair, like you used
to, morher."</p>

<p>"That will come by and by, Jennie."</p>

<p>"But long before I am so big, you'll be
quite well, morher."</p>

<p>"I hope so, dear, if God pleases. It's a
long, long while to sit here helpless, able to do
nothing but tend poor baby, and see my dear
little daughter at the work her mother ought
to do."</p>

<p>"Oh, morher, just as if I did not like to
work! I don't like 'e reason why I have to
do it, but it's right nice to work for you and
farher. And I wouldn't like to be lazy, so I
hope I will always have plenty to do."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear child," said Mrs. Richards, with a
sigh, "you're like enough to see that wish
granted."</p>

<p>"'At's good," said Jennie, cheerfully, taking
her mother's words in quite a different
spirit from that in which they were spoken;
"it's so nice to be busy."</p>

<p>And indeed it would appear that this small
maiden&mdash;small even for her six years&mdash;did
think so; for as she talked she was trotting
about the room, busying herself with arranging
half a dozen trifles, which her quick eye
spied out, and which, according to her way of
thinking, were not just in proper order. First,
the hearth, on which no spot or speck was to
be seen, must be brushed up anew; next, the
corner of the table-cloth was to be twitched
into place, and a knife laid more exactly into
straight line; then a ball, belonging to one of
the younger children, was picked up and put
in the toy-basket, with the reminder to little
Tommy that father was coming, and the room
must be kept in good order. One would have
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
thought it was already as neat as hands could
make it. Plain enough it was, certainly, but
thoroughly comfortable. The carpet, though
somewhat worn, and pieced in more than one
place, was well swept and tidy, and the stove
and the kettle which sang merrily upon its
top were polished till they shone. The table
in the centre of the room was ready set for
tea, and, though it held no silver or cut glass,
the most dainty lady or gentleman in the land
need not have hesitated to take a meal from
its white cloth and spotless delf ware. The
only pieces of furniture which looked as if
they had ever cost much were a large mahogany
table with carved feet, which stood between
the windows, and a bookcase of the same
wood at the side of the fireplace; but both of
these were old-fashioned, and although they
might be worth much to their owners, would
have brought little if offered for sale. Not a
speck of dust, however, was to be seen upon
them or the rest of the furniture, which was
of stained pine; while at the side of Mrs.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Richards' arm-chair stood the baby's wicker
cradle, covered with a gay patchwork spread.
And that tiny quilt was the pride and delight
of Jennie's heart; for had she not put it all
together with her own small fingers? after
which, good Mrs. Granby, who lived up-stairs,
had quilted and lined it for her.</p>

<p>On the other side of the mother, sat, in a
low chair, a boy about nine years old. His
hands were folded helplessly together, and his
pale face wore a sad, patient, waiting look, as
if something were coming upon him which he
knew he must bear without a struggle. One
looking closer into his eyes might notice a
dull film overspreading them, for Willie Richards
was nearly blind, would be quite blind
in a few weeks, the doctors said.</p>

<p>Between Jennie and the baby came three
little boys, sturdy, healthy children, always
clamoring for bread and butter, and frequent
calls for bread and butter were becoming a serious
matter in the policeman's household; for
provisions were high, and it was not as easy
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
to feed eight mouths as it had been to feed
four. This year, too, there had been severe
sickness in the family, bringing great expenses
with it, and how the wants of the coming winter
were to be provided for, Sergeant Richards
could hardly tell.</p>

<p>With the early spring had come scarlet
fever. The younger children had gone through
it lightly, Jennie escaping altogether; but
poor Willie had been nigh to death, and the
terrible disease had left its mark in the blindness
which was creeping upon him. Then,
watching her boy at night, Mrs. Richards had
taken cold which had settled in her limbs, and
all through the summer months she had lain
helpless, unable even to lift her hand. And
what a faithful little nurse Jennie had been to
her! Then two months ago the baby sister
was born, whose coming Jennie had hailed
with such delight, but whose short life had so
far been all pain and suffering.</p>

<p>The mother was better now, able to sit all
day in the cushioned chair, where the strong
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
arms of her husband would place her in the
morning. But there she remained a prisoner,
unable to move a step or even to stand, though
she could so far use her hands as to tend her
baby. But Mrs. Richards had not felt quite
discouraged until to-day. Now a fresh trouble
had come, and she felt as if it were the
last drop in the cup already too full.</p>

<p>The children knew nothing of this, however,
and if mother's face was sadder than usual,
they thought it was the old racking pain in
her bones. The three little boys were at the
window, their chubby faces pressed against the
glass, peering out into the darkness for the
first glimpse of father. His duty had kept
him from home all day, and wife and children
were more than usually impatient for his coming.</p>

<p>It was a small, two-story, wooden house,
standing back from the street, with a courtyard
in front, in the corner of which grew an
old butternut tree. It bore but few nuts in
these latter days, to be sure, but it gave a fine
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
shade in the summer, and the young occupants
of the house took great pride and comfort
in it. The branches were almost bare
now, however, and the wind, which now and
then came sighing up the street, would strip
off some of the leaves which still remained,
and scatter them over the porch or fling them
against the window.</p>

<p>"You couldn't do wi'out me very well;
could you, morher?" said Jennie, as she
straightened the corner of the rug, "even if
good Mrs. Granby does come and do all the
washing and hard work."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I could not," answered Mrs. Richards.
"My Jennie has been hands and feet
to her mother for the last six months."</p>

<p>"And now she's eyes to Willie," said the
blind boy.</p>

<p>"And eyes to Willie," repeated his mother,
tenderly laying her hand on his head.</p>

<p>"And tongue to Tommy," added Willie,
with a smile.</p>

<p>Jennie laughed merrily; but as she was
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
about to answer, the click of the gate was
heard, and with shouts of "He's coming!"
from Charlie, "Poppy, poppy!" from the
younger boy, and a confused jargon from
Tommy, which no one but Jennie could understand,
the whole three tumbled down from
the window and rushed to the door. A moment
later it opened, and a tall, straight figure
in a policeman's uniform appeared.</p>

<p>"Halloa, you chaps!" said a cheery voice.
"Suppose two or three dozen of you get out
of the way and let me shut the door; it won't
do to keep a draught on mother."</p>

<p>He contrived to close the door, but as for
getting farther with three pair of fat arms
clasping his legs, that was quite impossible.
The father laughed, threw his cap upon a
chair, and catching up first one and then another
of his captors, tossed them by turns in
the air, gave each a hearty kiss, and set him
on his feet again.</p>

<p>"There, gentlemen, now let me get to
mother, if you please. Well, Mary, how has
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
it gone to-day? Poorly, eh?" as he saw
that in spite of the smile which welcomed him,
her cheek was paler and her eye sadder than
they had been when he left her in the morning.</p>

<p>"The pain is no worse, dear,&mdash;rather better
maybe," she answered; but her lip quivered
as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Then that monstrous baby of yours has
been worrying you. I am just going to sell
her to the first man who will give sixpence for
her."</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" rose from a chorus of young
voices, with, "She didn't worry scarcely any
to-day, farher," from Jennie, as she lifted her
face for his kiss.</p>

<p>Willie's turn came next, as rising from his
chair with his hand outstretched, he made a
step forward and reached his father's side.
One eye was quite dark, but through the
thick mist which was over the other, he could
faintly distinguish the tall, square figure,
though, except for the voice and the sounds of
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
welcome, he could not have told if it were his
father or a stranger standing there.</p>

<p>Then began the grand amusement of the
evening. Mr. Richards pulled down the covering
of the cradle, turned over the pillow,
looked under the table, peeped into the sugar-bowl,
pepper-pot, and stove, and at last pretended
to be much astonished to discover the
baby upon its mother's lap, after which the
hunt was carried on in search of a place big
enough to kiss. This performance was gone
through with every night, but never lost its
relish, being always considered a capital joke,
and was received with shouts of laughter and
great clapping of hands.</p>

<p>"Father," said Jennie, when Mr. Richards
was seated in the rocking-chair, with a boy on
each knee, "we have a great surprise for your
supper to-night."</p>

<p>If Jennie did not resemble her father in
size, she certainly did in feature. In both
there were the same clear, honest gray eyes,
the same crisp, short curls, the same ruddy
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
cheeks and full red lips, the same look of
kindly good-nature, with something of a spirit
of fun and mischief sparkling through it.</p>

<p>"You have; have you?" he answered.
"Well, I suppose you know it takes a deal to
surprise a member of police. We see too
many queer folks and queer doings to be easy
surprised. If you were to tell me you were
going to turn a bad, lazy girl, I might be surprised,
but I don't know as much short of
that would do it."</p>

<p>Jennie shook her head with a very knowing
look at her mother, and just then the door
opened again and a head was put within.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're home, be you, Sergeant Richards?"
said the owner of the head. "All
right; your supper will be ready in a jiffy.
Come along, Jennie."</p>

<p>With this the head disappeared, and Jennie,
obeying orders, followed. In five minutes
they both returned, the head this time bringing
the rest of the person with it, carrying a
tray. Jennie held in her hands a covered
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
dish, which she set upon the edge of the table
with an air of great triumph. She was not
tall enough to put it in the proper spot before
her father's place; but she would by no means
suffer him to help her, although he offered to
do so. No, it must wait till Mrs. Granby had
emptied the tray, and could take it from her
hands.</p>

<p>What the policeman's family would have
done at this time without Mrs. Granby would
be hard to tell. Although a neighbor, she
had been almost a stranger to them till the
time of Willie's illness, when she had come in
to assist in the nursing. From that day she
had been a kind and faithful friend. She was
a seamstress, and went out to work by the
day; but night and morning she came in to
see Mrs. Richards and do what she could to
help her, until one evening she had asked Mr.
Richards if she might have a talk with him.
The policeman said, "Certainly," though he
was rather surprised, for Mrs. Granby generally
talked without waiting for permission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess things ain't going just right with
you; be they, Sergeant Richards?" she began.</p>

<p>Richards shook his head sadly. "I suppose
if it wasn't right, it wouldn't be, Mrs.
Granby; but it's hard to think it with Mary
lying there, bound hand and foot, my boy
growing blind, and the poor little baby more
dead than alive; with me away the best part
of the day, and nobody but that green Irish
girl to do a hand's turn for them all, unless
yourself or some other kind body looks in.
Jennie's a wonderful smart child, to be sure;
but there's another sore cross, to see her working
her young life out, when she ought to be
thinking of nothing but her play. And then,
how we're going to make both ends meet this
year, I don't know."</p>

<p>"So I thought," answered Mrs. Granby;
"and it's the same with me about the ends
meetin'. Now just supposin' we helped one
another along a bit. You see they've raised
my rent on me, and I can't afford it no way;
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
besides that, my eyes is givin' out,&mdash;won't
stand sewin' all day like they used to; so I'm
not goin' out by the day no more, but just goin'
to take in a bit of work and do it as I can.
That Biddy of yours ain't no good,&mdash;a dirty
thing that's as like as not to sweep with the
wrong end of the broom, and to carry the baby
with its head down and heels up. She just
worries your wife's life out; and every time
she goes lumberin' over the floor, Mary is
ready to screech with the jar. Now you just
send her packin', give me the little room up-stairs
rent free for this winter, and the use of
your fire for my bits of meals, and I'll do all
she does and more too,&mdash;washin', scrubbin',
cookin', and nussin'. You won't have no
wages to pay, and though they mayn't come
to much, every little tells; and Mary and the
babies will be a sight more comfortable, and
you, too, maybe, if I oughtn't to say it. You're
just right, too, about Jennie. It goes to
my heart to see her begin to put her hand to
everything; she's more willin' than she's able.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Pity everybody wasn't the same; it would
make another sort of a world, I guess. What
do you say to it? Will it do?"</p>

<p>Do! The policeman thought so indeed, and
was only too thankful. But it was a one-sided
kind of a bargain, he said, all on their
side, and Mrs. Granby must take some pay
for her services.</p>

<p>This she refused; she was not going to give
them all her time, only part of it, and the
room rent free was pay enough. But at last
she consented to take her meals with them,
though somehow she contrived to add more to
the rather slender table than she took from it.
Now she had a chicken or tender steak for
Mrs. Richards, "it was so cheap she couldn't
help buying it, and she had a fancy for a bit herself,"
but it was always a very small bit that
satisfied her; now a few cakes for the children,
now a pound of extra nice tea or coffee.
"Sergeant Richards needed something good
and hot when he came in from duty, and he
never took nothin' stronger, so he ought to
have it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>From the time that she came to them, Mrs.
Richards began to improve; there was no
longer any need to worry over her disorderly
house, neglected children, or the loss of comfort
to her husband. The baby ceased its endless
wailing, and with Jennie to keep things
trim after they had once been put in order,
the whole household put on its old air of cosy
neatness. Truly she had proved "a friend in
need," this cheerful, bustling, kind-hearted
little woman.</p>

<p>"Now you may uncover the dish, farher,"
said Jennie, as having brought a little stand
and placed it at her mother's side, she led
Willie to the table.</p>

<p>Mr. Richards did so. "Broiled ham and
eggs!" he exclaimed. "Why, the breath is
'most taken out of me! I know where the
ham came from well enough, for I bought it
myself, but I'd like to know who has been
buying fresh eggs at eight cents apiece."</p>

<p>"No, Sergeant Richards, you needn't look
at me that way," said Mrs. Granby, holding
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
up the tea-pot in one hand; "I ain't been doin'
no such expenses. I brought them home, to
be sure; but they was a present, not to me
neither, but to your wife here. Here's another
of 'em for her, boiled to a turn too. Fried
eggs ain't good for sick folks. 'Twasn't my
doin' that you got some with your ham
neither; I wanted to keep 'em for her eatin',
but she said you was so fond of 'em, and she
coaxed me into it. She does set such a heap
by you, she thinks nothin' ain't too good for
you. Not that I blame her. I often says
there ain't a better husband and father to be
found than Sergeant Richards, look the city
through; and you do deserve the best, that's a
fact, if it was gold and diamonds; not that you
wouldn't have a better use for them than to
eat 'em; diamonds fetches a heap, they tell
me, but never havin' had none of my own, I
can't rightly tell of my own showin'. Come,
eat while it's hot. I'll see to your wife. No,
thank you, none for me. I couldn't eat a
mouthful if you was to pay me for it. Don't
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
give the little ones none, 'taint good for 'em
goin' to bed. Jennie might have a bit, she's
been stirrin' round so all day, and Willie, too,
dear boy." Mrs. Granby's voice always took
a tenderer tone when she spoke of Willie.
"Well, I'll just tell you how I come by them
eggs. This afternoon I took home some work
to an old lady, a new customer Mrs. Howard
recommended me to. When I was let in,
there she stood in the hall, talkin' to a woman
what had been sellin' fresh eggs to her.
There they was, two or three dozen of 'em,
piled up, lookin' so fresh and white and nice,
enough to make your mouth water when you
looked at 'em and thought what a deal of
nourishment was in 'em. So when the lady
was through with the woman, says I, 'If you'll
excuse the liberty, ma'am, in your house and
your presence, I'd just like to take a couple
of eggs from this woman before she goes.'</p>

<p>"'Certainly,' says the lady, but the woman
says, 'I can't spare no more, there's only a
dozen left, and I've promised them to another
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
lady;' and off she goes. Well, me and the old
lady settles about the work, and she tells me
she'll have more in a month's time, and then
she says, 'You was disappointed about the
eggs?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, ma'am,' says I.</p>

<p>"So, thinkin', I s'pose, 'twasn't for a poor
seamstress like me to be so extravagant, she
says, 'Eggs are high this season,&mdash;eight cents
apiece.'</p>

<p>"I didn't want to be settin' myself up, but
I wasn't goin' to have her take no false notions
about me, so I says, 'Yes, ma'am, but
when a body's sick, and ain't no appetite to
eat only what one forces one's self to, I don't
think it no sin to spend a bit for a nice
nourishin' mouthful.'</p>

<p>"And she says, very gentle, 'Are you
sick?'</p>

<p>"'Not I, ma'am,' says I, 'but a friend of
mine. Bad with the rheumatics these six
months, and she's a mite of an ailin' baby,
and don't fancy nothin' to eat unless it's somethin'
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
delicate and fancy, so I just took a notion
I'd get a couple of them eggs for her.'</p>

<p>"And she says, 'I see you have a basket
there, just let me give you half a dozen of
these for your friend.' I never thought of
such a thing, and I was took all aback, and I
said would she please take it out of the work.
I couldn't think of takin' it in the way of
charity, and she says, 'If I were ill, and you
had any little dainty you thought I might like,
would you think it charity to offer it to me?'</p>

<p>"'No, ma'am,' says I; 'but then there's a
difference.'</p>

<p>"'I see none in that way,' she said; 'we
are all God's children. To one he gives more
than to another, but he means that we shall
help each other as we find opportunity, and I
wish you to take this little gift for your friend
as readily as you would offer it to me if I were
in like need.' Now wasn't that pretty? A
real lady, every inch of her. And with her
own hands she laid half a dozen eggs in the
basket. She was askin' some more questions
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
about my sick friend, when somebody pulls the
door-bell as furious, and when it was opened,
there was a servant-gal lookin' as scared as anything,
and she tells the old lady her little granddaughter
was lost, and couldn't be found
nowhere, and was she here, and did they
know anything about her? Well, they didn't
know nothin', and the old lady said she'd be
round right away, and she herself looked scared
ready to drop, and I see she hadn't no more
thought for me nor my belongin's, nor couldn't
be expected to, so I just takes my leave. And
when I come home and shows Mary the eggs,
nothin' would do but you must have a couple
cooked with your ham for supper."</p>

<p>All the time Mrs. Granby had been telling
her story, she was pouring out tea, waiting on
Mrs. Richards, spreading bread and butter for
the children, and now having talked herself
out of breath, she paused. At the last part of
the story, the police-sergeant laid down his
knife and fork, and looked up at her.</p>

<p>"What is your lady's name?" he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mrs. Stanton," answered Mrs. Granby.</p>

<p>"And who is the child that was lost?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, only a granddaughter; I
don't know if it's the same name. Why, have
you seen the child?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell if it's the same," answered
Richards, "but I've got a story for you to-night.
I have been thinking all the afternoon
I had a treat for Jennie."</p>

<p>"Is it a duty story, farher?" asked his
little daughter.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is a duty story."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's good!"</p>

<p class="pmb3">Whenever her father had a story to tell of
anything which had happened to him during
his daily duties, Jennie always called it a
"duty story," and she was very eager for such
anecdotes.</p>

ea was over, the dishes neatly washed
and put away by Mrs. Granby and
Jennie, the three little boys snugly
tucked in their cribs up-stairs, the baby lying
quiet in its cradle, and Mrs. Granby seated
at the corner of the table with her sewing.
Jennie sat upon her father's knee, and Willie
in his usual seat at his mother's side, and the
policeman began his story.</p>

<p>"It might have been about two o'clock
when, as I was at my desk, making out a report,
Policeman Neal came in with a lost
child in his arms, as pretty a little thing as
ever I saw, for all she did look as if she had
been having rather a hard time of it,&mdash;a
gentleman's child and a mother's darling, used
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
to be well cared for, as was easy to be seen
by her nice white frock with blue ribbons, and
her dainty shoes and stockings. But I think
her mother's heart would have ached if she
had seen her then. She had lost her hat, and
the wind had tossed up her curls, her cheeks
were pale and streaked with tears, and her big
brown eyes had a pitiful look in them that
would have softened a tiger, let alone a
man that had half a dozen little ones of
his own at home; while every now and then
the great heavy sighs came struggling up, as
if she had almost cried her heart out.</p>

<p>"When Neal brought her in, she looked
round as if she expected to see some one, and so
it seems she did; for he put her on thinking
she'd find some of her own folks waiting
for her. And when she saw there was no one
there, such a disappointed look as came over
her face, and her lip shook, and she clasped
both little hands over her throat, as if to keep
back the sobs from breaking out again. A
many lost children I've seen, but never one
who touched me like her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Neal told where he'd found her,
and a good way she'd wandered from her
home, as we found afterwards, and how she
said her name was Brightfort, which was as
near as he'd come to it; for she had a crooked
little tongue, though a sweet one. I looked
in the directory, but no name like that could
I find. Then Neal was going to put her down
and go back to his beat, but she clung fast to
him and began to cry again. You see, she'd
kind of made friends with him, and she didn't
fancy being left with strange faces again. So
I just took her from him, and coaxed her up
a bit, and told her I'd show her the telegraph
sending off a message how she was there. I
put her on the desk, close to me, while I set
the wires to work; and as sure as you live,
what did I hear that minute but her saying a
bit of a prayer. She didn't mean any one
to hear but Him she was speaking to, but I
caught every word; for you see my head was
bent over near to hers. And I'll never forget
it, not if I live to be a hundred, no, nor
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
the way it made me feel. 'Dear Father in
heaven,' she said, 'please let my own home
father come and find me very soon, 'cause I'm
so tired, and I want my own mamma; and
don't let those naughty boys hurt my Flossy,
but let papa find him too.' I hadn't felt so
chirk as I might all day, and it just went to
the soft place in my heart; and it gave me a
lesson, too, that I sha'n't forget in a hurry."</p>

<p>Mr. Richards stopped and cleared his
throat, and his wife took up the corner of her
shawl and wiped her eyes.</p>

<p>"Bless her!" said Mrs. Granby, winking
hers very hard.</p>

<p>"Ay, bless her, I say, too," continued the
policeman. "It was as pretty a bit of faith
and trust as ever I saw; and after it she
seemed some comforted, and sat quiet, watching
the working of the wires, as if she was
quite sure the One she'd looked to would
bring her help. Well, I carried her round
and showed her all there was to see, which
wasn't much, and then I set her to talking, to
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
see if I could find out where she belonged. I
saw she'd been confused and worried before
Neal brought her in, and I thought like
enough she'd forgotten. So, after some coaxing
and letting her tell her story in her own
way,&mdash;how her dog ran away and she ran
after him, and so got lost, she suddenly remembered
the name and number of the street
where she lived. With that she broke down
again, and began to cry and sob out, she did
want to go home so much.</p>

<p>"I was just sending out to see if she was
right, when up dashes a carriage to the door,
and out gets a gentleman on crutches. The
moment the little one set eyes on him, she
screams out as joyful as you please, 'Oh, it's
my soldier, it's my soldier!'</p>

<p>"Talk of an April day! You never saw
anything like the way the sunlight broke
through the clouds on her face. The moment
he was inside the door, she fairly flung herself
out of my arms on to his neck; and it was
just the prettiest thing in the world to see her
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
joy and love, and how she kissed and hugged
him. As for him, he dropped one crutch, and
held fast to her, as if for dear life. I knew
who he was well enough, for I had seen him
before, and found out about him, being in the
way of duty. He's an English colonel that
lives at the &mdash;&mdash; Hotel; and they tell wonderful
stories about him,&mdash;how brave he is, and
what a lot of battles he's fought, and how, with
just a handful of soldiers, he defended a hospital
full of sick men against a great force of
them murdering Sepoys, and brought every
man of them safe off. All sorts of fine things
are told about him; and I'm bound they're
true; for you can tell by the look of him he's
a hero of the right sort. I didn't think the
less of him, either, that I saw his eyes mighty
shiny as he and the baby held fast to each
other. She wasn't his child, though, but Mr.
Bradford's up in &mdash;&mdash; Street, whom I know all
about; and if that crooked little tongue of
hers could have said 'R,' which it couldn't, I
might have taken her home at once. Well,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
she was all right then, and he carried her off;
but first she walked round and made her
manners to every man there as polite as you
please, looking the daintiest little lady that
ever walked on two feet; and when I put her
into the carriage, didn't she thank me for letting
her into the station, and being kind to
her, as if it was a favor I'd been doing, and not
my duty; and as if a man could help it that
once looked at her. So she was driven away,
and I was sorry to lose sight of her, for I don't
know as I ever took so to a child that didn't
belong to me."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" asked Jennie, as her father
paused.</p>

<p>"That's all."</p>

<p>"How old was she, farher?"</p>

<p>"Five years old, she said, but she didn't
look it. It seemed to me when I first saw
her as if she was about your size; but you're
bigger than she, though you don't make much
show for your six years."</p>

<p>"How funny she can't say 'R' when she's
five years old!" said Jennie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, almost as funny as that my girl of
six can't say 'th,'" laughed the sergeant.</p>

<p>Jennie smiled, colored, and hung her head.</p>

<p>"And you thought maybe your lost child
was Mrs. Stanton's granddaughter; did you?"
asked Mrs. Granby.</p>

<p>"Well, I thought it might be. Two children
in that way of life ain't likely to be lost the
same day in the same neighborhood; and we
had no notice of any other but my little friend.
You don't know if Mrs. Stanton has any relations
of the name of Bradford?"</p>

<p>"No; she's 'most a stranger to me, and the
scared girl didn't mention no names, only
said little Bessie was missin'."</p>

<p>"That's her then. Little Bradford's name
was Bessie; so putting two and two together,
I think they're one and the same."</p>

<p>They talked a while longer of little Bessie
and her pretty ways and her friend, the colonel;
and then Mrs. Granby carried Willie and
Jennie off to bed.</p>

<p>"Now, Mary," said Richards, going to his
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
wife's side the moment the children were out
of hearing, "I know your poor heart has been
aching all day to know what the eye-doctor
said; but the boy sticks so close to you, and
his ears are so quick, that I couldn't do more
than whisper 'yes' when I came in, just to
let you know it could be done. I was bringing
Willie home when I met Jarvis with a
message that I was to go up to the Chief on
special business, so, as I hadn't a minute to
spare, I just had to hand the poor little man
over to Jarvis, who promised to see him safely
in your care. Dr. Dawson says, Mary, that
he thinks Willie can be cured; but we must
wait a while, and he thinks it best that he
should not be told until the time comes. The
operation cannot be performed till the boy
is stronger; and it is best not to attempt it
till the blindness is total,&mdash;till both eyes are
quite dark. Meanwhile, he must be fed upon
good nourishing food. If we can do this,
he thinks in three months, or perhaps four,
the child may be able to bear the operation.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
After that he says we must still be very careful
of him, and see that his strength does not
run down; and when the spring opens, we
must send him away from town, up among
the mountains. And that's what your doctor
says of you, too, Mary; that you won't get
well of this dreadful rheumatism till you have
a change of air; and that next summer I
ought to send you where you will have mountain
air. Dr. Dawson's charge," Richards
went on more slowly, "will be a hundred dollars,&mdash;he
says to rich folks it would be three
hundred, maybe more. But five thousand is
easier come at by a good many people than a
hundred is by us. So now we know what
the doctor can do, we must make out what
we can do. I'm free to say I think Willie
stands a better chance with Dr. Dawson than
he does elsewhere; but I don't see how
we are to raise the money. I'd live on
bread and water, or worse, lie on the bare
boards and work like a slave, to bring our
boy's sight back; but I can't see you suffer;
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
and we have the rest of the flock to think of
as well as Willie. And I suppose it must bring
a deal of expense on us, both before and after
the operation; at least, if we follow out the
doctor's directions, and he says if we don't,
the money and trouble will be worse than
thrown away.</p>

<p>"The first thing I have to do is to see
Dr. Schwitz, and find out how much we owe
him for attending you and the children, off
and on, these six months. I've asked him
half a dozen times for his bill, but he always
said 'no hurry' and he 'could wait;' and
since he was so kind, and other things were
so pressing, I've just let it go by."</p>

<p>When he had spoken of the doctor's hope
of curing Willie, his wife's pale face had
brightened; but as he went on to say what
it would cost, her head drooped; and now as
he spoke of the other doctor's bill, she covered
her face with her hands, and burst into tears
and sobs.</p>

<p class="pmb2">"Why, Mary, what is it, dear?"</p>

<p class="pmb2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Tom! Tom!" she broke forth, "Dr.
Schwitz sent his bill this morning. A rough-looking
man brought it, and he says the doctor
must have it the first of the year, and&mdash;and&mdash;"
She could get no farther. The poor
woman! it was no wonder; she was sick and
weak, and this unlooked-for trouble had quite
broken her down.</p>

<p>"Now, don't, Mary, don't be so cast down,"
said her husband. "We'll see our way out
of this yet. The Lord hasn't forsaken us."</p>

<p>"I don't know," she answered between her
sobs, "it 'most seems like it;" and taking up a
book which lay upon the table, she drew from
between its leaves a folded paper and handed
it to him. He was a strong, sturdy man, this
police-sergeant, used to terrible sights, and
not easily startled or surprised, as he had told
his little daughter; but when he opened the
paper and looked at it, all the color left his
ruddy cheeks, and he sat gazing at it as if
he were stunned. There was a moment's
silence; then the baby set up its pitiful little
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
cry. Mrs. Richards lifted it from the cradle.</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom," she said, "if it would please
the Lord to take baby and me, it would be far
better for you. I've been only a burden to
you these six months past, and I'm likely to
be no better for six months to come, for they
say I can't get well till the warm weather
comes again. You'd be better without us
dear, and it's me that's brought this on you."</p>

<p>Then the policeman roused himself.</p>

<p>"That's the hardest word you've spoken to
me these ten years we've been married, Mary,
woman," he said. "No, I thank the Lord
again and again that that trouble hasn't come
to me yet. What would I do without you,
Mary, dear? How could I bear it to come
home and not find you here,&mdash;never again
to see you smile when I come in; never to hear
you say, 'I'm so glad you've come, Tom;'
never to get the kiss that puts heart into me
after a hard day's work? And the babies,&mdash;would
you wish them motherless? To be
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
sure, you can't do for them what you once
did, but that will all come right yet; and
there's the mother's eye to overlook and see
that things don't go too far wrong; here's
the mother voice and the mother smile for
them to turn to. No, no; don't you think
you're laid aside for useless yet, dear. As for
this wee dolly,"&mdash;and the father laid his great
hand tenderly on the tiny bundle in its
mother's arms,&mdash;"why, I think I've come to
love her all the more for that she's so feeble
and such a care. And what would our Jennie
do without the little sister that she has such a
pride in and lays so many plans for? Why,
it would break her heart to lose her. No, no,
Mary, I can bear all things short of that
you've spoken of; and do you just pray the
Lord that he'll not take you at your word, and
never hurt me by saying a thing like that
again."</p>

<p>Trying to cheer his wife, the brave-hearted
fellow had almost talked himself into cheerfulness
again; and Mrs. Richards looked up
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
through her tears. "And what are we to do,
Tom?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I can't just rightly see my way clear yet,"
he answered, thoughtfully, rubbing his forehead
with his finger; "but one thing is certain,
we've got to look all our troubles straight
in the face, and to see what we can do. What
we <i>can</i> do for ourselves we <i>must</i>, then trust
the Lord for the rest. As I told you, that little
soul that was brought up to the station
this afternoon gave me a lesson I don't mean
to forget in a hurry. There she was, the innocent
thing, in the worst trouble I suppose
that could come to such a baby,&mdash;far from
her home and friends, feeling as if she'd lost
all she had in the world,&mdash;all strange faces
about her, and in what was to her a terrible
place, and not knowing how she was to get out
of it. Well, what does she do, the pretty
creature, but just catch herself up in the
midst of her grieving and say that bit of a
prayer? and then she rested quiet and waited.
It gave me a sharp prick, I can tell you, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
one that I needed. Says I to myself, 'Tom
Richards, you haven't half the faith or the
courage of this baby.' There had I been all
day fretting myself and quarrelling with the
Lord's doings, because he had brought me
into a place where I could not see my way
out. I had asked for help, too, or thought I
had, and yet there I was, faithless and unbelieving,
not willing to wait his time and way to
bring it to me. But she, baby as she was,
knew in whom she had trusted, and could
leave herself in his hands after she had once
done all she knew how. It's not the first
teaching I've had from a little child, Mary,
and I don't expect it will be the last; but
nothing ever brought me up as straight as
that did. Thinks I, the Lord forgive me, and
grant me such a share of trust and patience as
is given to this his little one; and then I took
heart, and I don't think I've lost it again, if I
have had a hard blow I did not look for. I
own I was a bit stunned at first; but see you,
Mary, I am sure this bill is not fair. Dr.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Schwitz has overcharged us for certain; and
I don't believe it will stand in law."</p>

<p>"But we can't afford to go to law, Tom,
any more than to pay this sum. Four hundred
dollars!"</p>

<p>"I would not wonder if Mr. Ray would see
me through this," said Richards. "He's a
good friend to me. I'll see him, anyhow. I
never thought Dr. Schwitz would serve me
like this; it's just revenge."</p>

<p>"Have you offended him?" asked Mrs.
Richards, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the policeman. "Yesterday
I had to arrest a nephew of his for robbing
his employer. Schwitz came to me and
begged I'd let him off and pretend he was not
to be found, saying he would make it worthwhile
to me. I took offence at his trying to
bribe me, which was but natural, you will allow,
Mary, and spoke up pretty sharp. He
swore he'd make me pay for it if I touched the
lad; but I never thought he would go this far.
And to think I have had the handling of so
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
many rogues, and didn't know one when I
saw him!"</p>

<p>"And Willie?" said the poor mother.</p>

<p>"Ah! that's the worst," answered Richards.
"I'm afraid we sha'n't be able to have
much done for Willie this next year; for even
if Dr. Dawson will wait for his pay, there's all
the expense that's to come before and after
the operation; and I don't see how we are
going to manage it."</p>

<p class="pmb3">Long the good policeman and his wife sat
and talked over their troubles; and when
kind Mrs. Granby came back, she was told of
them, and her advice asked; but three heads
were no better than two in making one dollar
do the needful work of ten.</p>

hree young ladies sat talking over
their work in the pleasant bow-window
of Mrs. Stanton's sitting-room, while
at a short distance from them two little curly
heads bent over the great picture-book which
lay upon the table. The eyes in the curly
heads were busy with the pictures, the tongues
in the curly heads were silent, save when
now and then one whispered, "Shall I turn
over?" or "Is not that pretty?" but the ears
in the curly heads were wide open to all that
was passing in the bow-window; while the
three young ladies, thinking that the curly
heads were heeding nothing but their own
affairs, went on chattering as if those attentive
ears were miles away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Annie," said Miss Carrie Hall, "I am
sorry to hear of the severe affliction likely to
befall your sister, Mrs. Bradford."</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Annie Stanton,
looking up surprised.</p>

<p>"I heard that Mrs. Lawrence, Mr. Bradford's
Aunt Patty, was coming to make her a
visit."</p>

<p>"Ah, poor Margaret!" said Annie Stanton,
but she laughed as she spoke. "It is indeed a
trial, but my sister receives it with becoming
submission."</p>

<p>"Why does Mrs. Bradford invite her when
she always makes herself so disagreeable?"
asked Miss Ellis.</p>

<p>"She comes self-invited," replied Annie.
"Margaret did not ask her."</p>

<p>"I should think not, considering the circumstances
under which they last parted,"
said Carrie Hall.</p>

<p>"Oh, Margaret has long since forgotten and
forgiven all that," said Annie, "and she and
Mr. Bradford have several times endeavored
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
to bring about a reconciliation, inviting Aunt
Patty to visit them, or sending kind messages
and other tokens of good-will. The old lady,
however, was not to be appeased, and for the
last three or four years has held no intercourse
with my brother's family. Now she
suddenly writes, saying she intends to make
them a visit."</p>

<p>"I should decline it if I were in the place
of Mr. and Mrs. Bradford," said Carrie.</p>

<p>"I fear I should do the same," replied
Annie, "but Margaret and Mr. Bradford are
more forgiving. I am quite sure though that
they look upon this visit as a duty to be endured,
not a pleasure to be enjoyed, especially
as the children are now older, and she will
be the more likely to make trouble with
them."</p>

<p>"I suppose they have quite forgotten her,"
said Carrie.</p>

<p>"Harry and Fred may remember her,"
answered Annie, "but the others were too
young to recollect her at this distance of
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
time. Bessie was a baby, Maggie scarcely
three years old."</p>

<p>"Shall you ever forget the day we stopped
at your sister's house on our way home from
school, and found Mrs. Lawrence and nurse
having a battle royal over Maggie?" asked the
laughing Carrie.</p>

<p>"No, indeed! Nurse, with Maggie on one
arm and Bessie on the other, fairly dancing
about the room in her efforts to save the former
from Aunt Patty's clutches, both terrified
babies screaming at the top of their voices,
both old women scolding at the top of theirs;
while Fred, the monkey, young as he was,
stood by, clapping his hands and setting them
at each other as if they had been two cats."</p>

<p>"And your sister," said Carrie, "coming
home to be frightened half out of her senses at
finding such an uproar in her well-ordered
nursery, and poor little Maggie stretching out
her arms to her with 'Patty vip me, Patty
vip me!'"</p>

<p>"And Margaret quite unable to quell the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
storm until Brother Henry came in and with
a few determined words separated the combatants
by sending nurse from the room,"
continued Annie, with increasing merriment.
"Poor mammy! She knew her master's word
was not to be disputed, and dared not disobey;
but I think she has never quite forgiven
him for that, and still looks upon it as hard
that when, as she said, she had a chance 'to
speak her mind to Mrs. Lawrence,' she was
not allowed to do it."</p>

<p>"But what caused the trouble?" asked
Laura Ellis.</p>

<p>"Oh, some trifling mischief of Maggie's, for
which auntie undertook to punish her severely.
Nurse interfered, and where the battle would
have stopped, had not Henry and Margaret
arrived, it is difficult to tell."</p>

<p>"But surely she did not leave your brother's
house in anger for such a little thing as that!"
said Laura.</p>

<p>"Indeed, she did; at least, she insisted that
Maggie should be punished and nurse dismissed.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Dear old mammy, who nursed every
one of us, from Ruthven down to myself, and
whom mother gave to Margaret as a treasure
past all price when Harry was born,&mdash;poor
mammy, who considers herself quite as much
one of the family as any Stanton, Duncan, or
Bradford among us all,&mdash;to talk of dismissing
her! But nothing less would satisfy Aunt
Patty; and Margaret gently claiming the
right to correct her own children and govern
her own household as she saw fit, and Henry
firmly upholding his wife, Aunt Patty departed
that very afternoon in a tremendous passion,
and has never entered the house since."</p>

<p>"Greatly to your sister's relief, I should
think," said Laura. "Why, what a very disagreeable
inmate she must be, Annie! I am
sure I pity Mrs. Bradford and all her family,
if they are to undergo another visit from her
now."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Annie. "Some sudden freak
has taken her, and she has written to say that
she will be here next month. You may well
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
pity them. Such another exacting, meddling,
ill-tempered old woman it would be difficult to
find. She has long since quarrelled with all
her relations; indeed, it was quite wonderful to
every one how Margaret and her husband bore
with her as long as they did. I do not know
how the poor children will get on with her.
She and Fred will clash before she has been in
the house a day, while the little ones will be
frightened out of their senses by one look
of those cold, stern eyes. Do you remember,
Carrie, how, during that last unfortunate visit,
Maggie used to run and hide her head in her
mother's dress the moment she heard Aunt
Patty's step?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," said Carrie. "I suppose
she will be here at Christmas time too. Poor
little things! She will destroy half their
pleasure."</p>

<p>All this and much more to the same purpose
fell upon those attentive ears, filling the
hearts of the little listeners with astonishment
and dismay. It was long since Maggie's hand
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
had turned a leaf of the scrap-book, long since
she or Bessie had given a look or thought to
the pictures. There they both sat, motionless,
gazing at one another, and drinking in all the
foolish talk of those thoughtless young ladies.</p>

<p>They meant no harm, these gay girls. Not
one of them but would have been shocked at
the thought that she was poisoning the minds
of the dear little children whom they all loved
towards the aged relative whom they were
bound to reverence and respect. They had
not imagined that Maggie and Bessie were attending
to their conversation, and they were
only amusing themselves; it was but idle
talk. Ah, idle talk, idle words, of which each
one of us must give account at the last great
day!</p>

<p>So they sat and chatted away, not thinking
of the mischief they might be doing, until, at a
question from Miss Carrie, Annie Stanton
dropped her voice as she answered. Still now
and then a few words would reach the little
ones. "Shocking temper"&mdash;"Poor Margaret
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
so uncomfortable"&mdash;"Mr Bradford
very much displeased"&mdash;"patience quite
worn out" until Bessie said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Aunt Annie, if you don't mean us to
know what you say, we do hear a little."</p>

<p>Aunt Annie started and colored, then said,
hastily "Oh, I had almost forgotten you were
there. Would you not like to go down-stairs,
pets, and ask old Dinah to bake a little cake
for each of you? Run then, and if you heard
what we were saying, do not think of it. It is
nothing for you to trouble your small heads
about. I am afraid we have been rather imprudent,"
she continued uneasily when her
little nieces had left the room. "Margaret is
so particular that her children shall hear
nothing like gossip or evil speaking, and I
think we have been indulging in both. If
Maggie and Bessie have been listening to what
we were saying, they will not have a very
pleasant impression of Mrs. Lawrence. Well,
there is no use in fretting about it now. What
is said cannot be unsaid; and they will soon
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
find out for themselves what the old lady
is."</p>

<p>Yes, what is said cannot be unsaid. Each little
word, as it is spoken, goes forth on its errand
of good or evil, and can never be recalled.</p>

<p>Perhaps Aunt Annie would have regretted
her thoughtlessness still more if she had seen
and heard the little girls as they stood together
in the hall. They had no thought of old
Dinah and the cakes with this important
matter to talk over. Not think of what they
heard, indeed! That was a curious thing for
Aunt Annie to say. She had been right in
believing that Maggie must have forgotten
Mrs. Lawrence. Maggie had done so, but
now this conversation had brought the whole
scene of the quarrel with nurse to her mind.
It all came back to her; but in recollection it
appeared far worse than the reality. Aunt
Patty's loud, angry voice seemed sounding in
her ears, uttering the most violent threats, and
she thought of the old lady herself almost
as if she had been some terrible monster,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
ready to tear in pieces her own poor frightened
little self, clinging about nurse's neck.</p>

<p>And was it possible that this dreadful old
woman was really coming again to their house
to make a visit? How could papa and mamma
think it best to allow it?</p>

<p>Such mischief had already been done by
idle talk!</p>

<p>"Maggie," said Bessie, "do you remember
about that Patty woman?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Maggie, "I did not remember
about her till Aunt Annie and Miss
Carrie said that, but I do now; and oh, Bessie,
she's <i>awful</i>! I wish, I wish mamma would
not let her come. She's the shockingest person
you ever saw."</p>

<p>"Aunt Annie said mamma did not want
her herself; but she let her come because she
thought it was right," said Bessie.</p>

<p>"I wonder why mamma thinks it is right
when she is so cross and tempered," said
Maggie, with a long sigh. "Why, she used to
scold even papa and mamma! Oh, I remember
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
her so well now. I wish I didn't; I don't
like to think about it;" and Maggie looked
very much distressed.</p>

<p>Bessie was almost as much troubled, but
she put her arm about her sister and said,
"Never matter, dear Maggie, papa and mamma
won't let her do anything to us."</p>

<p>"But suppose papa and mamma both had
to go out and leave us, as they did that day
she behaved so," said Maggie. "Nursey has so
many to take care of now, and maybe she'd
meddle again,&mdash;Aunt Annie said she was very
meddling too,&mdash;and try to punish me when I
did not do any blame."</p>

<p>"Jane would help nurse <i>pertect</i> us," said
Bessie, "and if she couldn't, we'd yun away
and hide till papa and mamma came."</p>

<p>"She shouldn't do anything to you, Bessie.
I wouldn't let her do that, anyhow," said
Maggie, shaking her head, and looking very
determined.</p>

<p>"How could you help it if she wanted to,
Maggie?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'd say, 'Beware, woman!'" said Maggie,
drawing her eyebrows into a frown, and extending
her hand with the forefinger raised in
a threatening manner.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Bessie, "what does that
mean?"</p>

<p>"I don't quite know," said Maggie, slowly,
"but it frightens people very much."</p>

<p>"It don't frighten me a bit when you say
it."</p>

<p>"'Cause you don't have a guilty conscience;
but if you had, you'd be, oh, so afraid!"</p>

<p>"How do you know I would?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," said Maggie. "Uncle John
had a picture paper the other day, and in it was
a picture of a woman coming in at the door,
and she had her hands up so, and she looked
as frightened, as frightened, and a man was
standing behind the curtain doing so, and
under the picture was 'Beware, woman!' I
asked Uncle John what it meant, and he
said that was a wicked woman who was going
to steal some papers so she could get some
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
money, and when she came in, she heard
somebody say, 'Beware, woman,' and she was
so frightened she ran away and was never seen
again. I asked him to tell me more about it,
but he said, 'No, it was a foolish story, not fit
for little people.' Then I asked him if foolish
stories were only fit for big people, but he just
laughed and pinched my cheek. But I coaxed
him to tell me why the woman was so
frightened when the man did nothing but say
those two words, and he said it was because
she had a guilty conscience, for wicked people
feared what good and innocent people did not
mind at all. So if that old Mrs. Patty&mdash;I
sha'n't call her aunt&mdash;don't behave herself to
you, Bessie, I'll just try it."</p>

<p>"Do you think she has a guilty conscience,
Maggie?"</p>

<p>"Course she has; how could she help it?"</p>

<p>"And will she yun away and never be seen
again?"</p>

<p>"I guess so," said Maggie; "anyhow, I
hope she will."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder why mamma did not tell us she
was coming," said Bessie.</p>

<p>"We'll ask her to-morrow. We can't do it
to-night because it will be so late before she
comes home from Riverside and we'll be
asleep, but we'll do it in the morning. And
now, don't let's think about that shocking person
any more. We'll go and ask Dinah about
the cakes."</p>

<p>But although they resolved to try to forget
Aunt Patty for the present, they could not
help thinking of her a good deal and talking of
her also, for their young hearts had been filled
with dread of the old lady and her intended
visit.</p>

<p class="pmb3">The reason that Mr. and Mrs. Bradford had
not spoken to their children of Mrs. Lawrence's
coming was that it was not yet a settled
thing; and as there was not much that was
pleasant to tell, they did not think it best to
speak of her unless it was necessary. It was
long since her name had been mentioned in
the family, <i>so</i> long that, as Mrs. Bradford had
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
hoped and supposed, all recollection of her
had passed from Maggie's mind, until the
conversation she had just heard had brought
it back.</p>

he next morning while they were at
breakfast, the postman brought three
letters for papa and mamma.</p>

<p>"Margaret," said Mr. Bradford, looking up
from one of his, "this is from Aunt Patty
to say that she will put off her visit until
spring."</p>

<p>Maggie and Bessie both looked up.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Mrs. Bradford, in a tone as if
she were rather more glad than sorry to hear
that Aunt Patty was not coming at present.
Papa glanced at her with a smile which did
not seem as if he were very much disappointed
either. Probably the children would not have
noticed tone or smile had they not been thinking
of what they heard yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Holloa!" said Fred, in a voice of dismay,
"Aunt Patty is not coming here again; is she?
You'll have to look out and mind your P's
and Q's, Midget and Bess, if that is the case.
We'll all have to for that matter. Whew-ee,
can't she scold though! I remember her
tongue if it is four years since I heard it."</p>

<p>"Fred, Fred!" said his father.</p>

<p>"It's true, papa; is it not?"</p>

<p>"If it is," replied his father, "it does not
make it proper for you to speak in that way
of one so much older than yourself, my boy.
Aunt Patty is not coming at present; when
she does come, I hope we shall all be ready to
receive her kindly and respectfully."</p>

<p>"I see you expect to find it difficult, papa,"
said the rogue, with a mischievous twinkle of
his eye. Before Mr. Bradford had time to
answer, Mrs. Bradford, who had been reading
her letter, exclaimed joyfully,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear Elizabeth Rush says she will come to
us at New Year, and make us a long visit. I
wish she could have come at Christmas, as I
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
begged her to do, but she says she has
promised to remain in Baltimore with her
sister until after the holidays."</p>

<p>"Mamma," said Bessie, "do you mean
Aunt Bessie is coming to stay with us?"</p>

<p>"Yes, darling. Are you not glad?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I am, mamma; I do love Aunt
Bessie, and the colonel will be glad too."</p>

<p>"That's jolly!" exclaimed Fred; and a
chorus of voices about the table told that Aunt
Bessie's coming was looked forward to with
very different feelings from those which Aunt
Patty's excited.</p>

<p>"Mamma," said Maggie suddenly, as they
were about leaving the table, "don't you wish
you had forty children?"</p>

<p>"Forty!" exclaimed Mrs. Bradford, laughing.
"No, that would be rather too large a
family, Maggie."</p>

<p>"But, mamma, if you had forty children,
the house would be so full there would never
be room for Aunt Patty."</p>

<p>The boys laughed, but mamma was grave
in a moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you remember Aunt Patty, my darling?"
she asked, looking rather anxiously at
Maggie.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, mamma, I remember her ever so
well," answered poor Maggie, coloring all over
her face and neck, and looking as if the remembrance
of Aunt Patty were a great distress.</p>

<p>"I thought you had quite forgotten her,
dear," said her mother.</p>

<p>"I had, mamma, but yesterday Aunt Annie
and Miss Carrie were talking about her, and
then I remembered her, oh! so well, and how
fierce she looked and what a loud voice she
had, and how she scolded, mamma, and how
angry she used to be, and oh! mamma, she's
such a dreadful old person, and if you only
wouldn't let her come to our house."</p>

<p>"And, mamma," said Bessie, "Aunt Annie
said nobody had any peace from the time she
came into the house until she went out, and
you know we're used to peace, so we can't do
without it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time Maggie was crying, and Bessie
very near it. Their mamma scarcely knew
how to comfort them, for whatever they might
have heard from Annie and her friends was
probably only too true; and both she and
papa had too much reason to fear with Bessie
that the usual "peace" of their happy household
would be sadly disturbed when Aunt
Patty should come there again. For though
the old lady was not so terrible as the little
girls imagined her to be, her unhappy temper
always made much trouble wherever she went.
All that Mrs. Bradford could do was to tell
them that they must be kind and respectful to
Mrs. Lawrence, and so give her no cause of
offence; and that in no case would she be
allowed to punish or harm them. But the
thing which gave them the most comfort was
that Aunt Patty's visit was not to take place
for some months, possibly not at all. Then
she talked of Miss Rush, and made pleasant
plans for the time when she should be with
them, and so tried to take their thoughts from
Aunt Patty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>"And Uncle Ruthven is coming home," said
Maggie. "Grandmamma had a letter from
him last night, and she said he promised to
come before the winter was over; and <i>won't</i>
we all be happy then?"</p>

<p>Mamma kissed her little daughter's April
face, on which the tears were not dry before
smiles were dancing in their place, and in
happy talk of Uncle Ruthven, Aunt Patty was
for the time forgotten.</p>

<p>Uncle Ruthven was mamma's only brother,
and a famous hero in the eyes of all the children.
None of them save Harry had ever
seen him, and he had been such a very little
boy when his uncle went away ten years ago,
that he could not recollect him. But his
letters and the stories of his travels and adventures
had always been a great delight to his
young nieces and nephews; and now that he
talked of coming home, they looked forward
to seeing him with almost as much pleasure
as if they had known him all their lives. As
for the mother and the sisters who had been
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
parted from him for so long, no words could
tell how glad they were. A sad rover was
Uncle Ruthven; it was easier to say where
he had not been than where he had. He
had climbed to the tops of high mountains
and gone down into mines which lay far below
the surface of the earth; had peeped into
volcanoes and been shut up among icebergs,
at one time had slung his hammock under the
trees of a tropical forest, at another had rolled
himself in his blankets in the frozen huts of
the Esquimaux; had hunted whales, bears,
lions, and tigers; had passed through all manner
of adventures and dangers by land and by
sea; and at last was really coming home,
"tired of his wanderings, to settle down beside
his dear old mother and spend the rest of his
days with her." So he had said in the letter
which came last night, and grandmamma had
read it over many times, smiled over it, cried
over it, and talked of the writer, until,
if Maggie and Bessie had doubted the fact before,
they must then have been quite convinced
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
that no other children ever possessed such a
wonderful uncle as this Uncle Ruthven of
theirs. When he would come was not quite
certain,&mdash;perhaps in two months, perhaps not
in three or four, while he might be here by
Christmas or even sooner.</p>

<p>And now came faithful old nurse to hear
the good news and to have her share in the
general family joy at the return of her first
nursling, her beloved "Master Ruthven."</p>

<p>"And will your Aunt Patty be here when he
comes, my dear lady?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I think not," said Mrs. Bradford, at which
mammy looked well pleased, though she said
no more; but Maggie and Bessie understood
the look quite well.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bradford had intended by and by to
talk to her children of Mrs. Lawrence and to
tell them that she was rather odd and different
from most of the people to whom they were
accustomed, but that they must be patient and
bear with her if she was sometimes a little
provoking and cross. But now she found that
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
they already knew quite too much, and she
was greatly disturbed when she thought that it
would be of little use to try and make them
feel kindly towards the old lady. But the
mischief had spread even farther than she had
imagined.</p>

<p>That afternoon Maggie and Bessie with
little Franky were all in their mamma's room,
seated side by side upon the floor, amusing
themselves with a picture-book. This book
belonged to Harry, who had made it himself
by taking the cuts from magazines and papers
and putting them in a large blank book. It
was thought by all the children to be something
very fine, and now Maggie sat with it upon
her lap while she turned over the leaves, explaining
such pictures as she knew, and inventing
meanings and stories for those which
were new to her.</p>

<p>Presently she came to one which quite puzzled
her. On the front of the picture was the
figure of a woman with an eagle upon her
shoulder, intended to represent America or
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
Liberty; while farther back stood a man with
a gun in his hand and a lion at his side, who
was meant for John Bull of England. Miss
America had her arm raised, and appeared to
be scolding Mr. England in the most terrible
manner. Maggie could not tell the meaning
of it, though she knew that the woman was
America, but Franky thought that he understood
it very well. Now Master Franky had
a good pair of ears, and knew how to make a
good use of them. He had, also, some funny
ideas of his own, and like many other little
children, did not always know when it was
best to keep them to himself. He had heard
a good deal that morning of some person
named Patty, who was said to scold very
much; he had also heard of his Uncle Ruthven,
and he knew that this famous uncle had
hunted lions in far-away Africa. The picture
of the angry woman and the lion brought all
this to his mind, and now he suddenly exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, my, my! Dere's a Patty wis her
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
chitten, and she stolds Uncle 'Utven wis his
lion."</p>

<p>This was too much for Maggie. Pushing
the book from her knees, she threw herself
back upon the carpet and rolled over, screaming
with laughter at the joke of America with
her eagle being mistaken for Aunt Patty with
a chicken; Bessie joined in, and Franky,
thinking he had said something very fine,
clapped his hands and stamped his feet upon
the floor in great glee. Mrs. Bradford herself
could not help smiling, partly at the droll
idea, partly at Maggie's amusement; but the
next moment she sighed to think how the
young minds of her children had been filled
with fear and dislike of their father's aunt,
and how much trouble all this was likely to
make.</p>

<p>"Children," said Mr. Bradford, that evening,
"who would like to hear a true story?"</p>

<p>Papa found he was not likely to want for
listeners, as three or four eager voices answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wait a moment, dear," he said, as Bessie
came to take her usual place upon his knee,
and rising, he unlocked a cabinet secretary
which stood at the side of the fireplace in his
library. This secretary was an object of great
interest to all the children, not because it held
papa's private papers,&mdash;those were trifles of
very little account in their eyes,&mdash;but because
it contained many a relic and treasure, remembrances
of bygone days, or which were
in themselves odd and curious. To almost
all of these belonged some interesting and
true story,&mdash;things which had happened
when papa was a boy, or even farther back
than that time,&mdash;tales of travel and adventure
in other lands, or perhaps of good and great
people. So they were pleased to see their
father go to his secretary when he had promised
"a true story," knowing that they were
sure of a treat.</p>

<p>Mr. Bradford came back with a small,
rather worn, red morocco case, and as soon as
they were all quietly settled, he opened it. It
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
held a miniature of a very lovely lady. Her
bright eyes were so sparkling with fun and
mischief that they looked as if they would almost
dance out of the picture, and the mouth
was so smiling and lifelike that it seemed as
if the rosy lips must part the next moment
with a joyous, ringing laugh. Her hair was
knotted loosely back with a ribbon, from
which it fell in just such dark, glossy ringlets
as clustered about Maggie's neck and shoulders.
It was a very beautiful likeness of a
very beautiful woman.</p>

<p>"Oh, how sweet, how lovely! What a
pretty lady!" exclaimed the children, as they
looked at it.</p>

<p>"Why, she looks like our Maggie!" said
Harry.</p>

<p>"Only don't flatter yourself you are such a
beauty as that, Midget," said Fred, mischievously.</p>

<p>"Oh, Fred," said Bessie, "my Maggie is a
great deal prettier, and I don't believe that
lady was so good as Maggie either."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>"She may have been very good," said Harry,
"but I don't believe she had half as sweet
a temper as our Midge. I'll answer for it that
those eyes could flash with something besides
fun; could they not, papa?"</p>

<p>"Was she a relation of yours, papa?"
asked Fred.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Mr. Bradford, "and I am
going to tell you a story about her."</p>

<p>"One summer, a good many years ago, two
boys were staying on their uncle's farm in the
country. Their father and mother were travelling
in Europe, and had left them in this
uncle's care while they should be absent. It
was a pleasant home, and the boys, accustomed
to a city life, enjoyed it more than I
can tell you. One afternoon, their uncle and
aunt went out to visit some friends, giving
the boys permission to amuse themselves out
of doors as long as they pleased. All the servants
about the place, except the old cook,
had been allowed to go to a fair which was
held in a village two or three miles away, so
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
that the house and farm seemed to be quite
deserted. Only one other member of the family
was at home, and this was an aunt whom
the boys did not love at all, and they were
only anxious to keep out of her way."</p>

<p>"Papa," said Fred, eagerly, "what were
the names of these boys and their aunt?"</p>

<p>"Ahem," said Mr. Bradford, with a twinkle
in his eye, as he saw Fred's knowing look.
"Well, I will call the oldest boy by my own
name, Henry, and the youngest we will call
Aleck."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Fred, "and the aunt's name
was, I suppose&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Henrietta," said his father, quickly; "and
if you have any remarks to make, Fred, please
keep them until my story is done."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," said Fred, with another
roguish look at Harry, and his father went on.</p>

<p>"Henry was a strong, healthy boy, who had
never known a day's sickness; but Aleck was
a weak, delicate, nervous little fellow, who
could bear no excitement nor fatigue. Different
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
as they were, however, the affection between
them was very great. Gentle little
Aleck looked up to his elder and stronger
brother with a love and confidence which were
beautiful to see, while the chief purpose of
Henry's life at this time was to fulfil the
charge which his mother had given him to
care for Aleck, and keep him as far as he
could from all trouble and harm, looking
upon it as a sacred trust.</p>

<p>"There was a large old barn standing at
some distance from the house, used only for
the storing of hay; and as they found the sun
too warm for play in the open air, Henry proposed
they should go there and make some
boats which later they might sail in the
brook. Aleck was ready enough, and they
were soon comfortably settled in the hayloft
with their knives and bits of wood. But
while they were happily working away, and
just as Henry was in the midst of some marvellous
story, they heard a voice calling them.</p>

<p>"'Oh, dear,' said little Aleck, 'there's Aunt
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
Henrietta! Now she'll make us go in the
house, and she'll give me my supper early and
send me to bed, though Aunt Mary said I
might sit up and have tea with the rest, even
if they came home late. Let us hide,
Henry.'</p>

<p>"No sooner said than done. The knives
and chips were whisked out of sight, Aleck
hidden beneath the hay. Henry, scrambling
into an old corn-bin, covered himself with the
corn-husks with which it was half filled, while
the voice and its owner came nearer and
nearer.</p>

<p>"'You'd better take care; she'll hear you,'
said Henry, as he heard Aleck's stifled laughter;
and the next moment, through a crack
in the bin, he saw his aunt's head appearing
above the stairs. Any stranger might have
wondered why the boys were so much afraid
of her. She was a tall, handsome lady, not
old, though the hair beneath her widow's cap
was white as snow. She stood a moment and
cast her sharp, bright eyes around the hayloft;
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
then, satisfied that the boys were not
there, went down again, saying quite loud
enough for them to hear,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'If I find them, I shall send Henry to bed
early, too; he's always leading dear little
Aleck into mischief. Such nonsense in Mary
to tell that sick baby he should sit up until
she came home!'</p>

<p>"Now it was a great mistake for auntie to
say this of Henry. He did many wrong
things, but I do not think he ever led his little
brother into mischief; on the contrary, his
love for Aleck often kept him from harm. So
his aunt's words made him very angry, and as
soon as he and Aleck had come out of their
hiding-places, he said many things he should
not have said, setting a bad example to Aleck,
who was also displeased at being called 'a sick
baby.'</p>

<p>"'Let's shut ourselves up in Dan's cubby-hole,'
said Henry; 'she'll never think of
looking for us there, if she comes back.'</p>

<p>"Dan's cubby-hole was a small room shut
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
off from the rest of the hayloft, where one of
the farm hands kept his tools; and here the
boys went, shutting and bolting the door behind
them. They worked away for more than
an hour, when Aleck asked his brother if he
did not smell smoke.</p>

<p>"'Not I,' said Henry; 'that little nose of
yours is always smelling something, Aleck.'</p>

<p>"Aleck laughed, but a few moments after
declared again that he really did smell smoke
and felt it too.</p>

<p>"'They are burning stubble in the fields;
it is that you notice,' said Henry. But presently
he sprang up, for the smell became
stronger, and he saw a little wreath of smoke
curling itself beneath the door. 'There is
something wrong,' he said, and hastily drawing
the bolt, he opened the door. What a
sight he saw! Heavy clouds of smoke were
pouring up the stairway from the lower floor
of the barn, while forked flames darted
through them, showing that a fierce fire was
raging below. Henry sprang forward to see
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
if the stairs were burning; but the flames,
fanned by the draught that came through the
door he had opened, rushed up with greater
fury, and drove him back. How could he
save Aleck? The fire was plainly at the foot
of the stairs, even if they were not already
burning, while those stifling clouds of smoke
rolled between them and the doors of the
haymow, and were now pouring up through
every chink and cranny of the floor on which
he stood. Not a moment was to be lost.
Henry ran back, and closing the door, said to
his terrified brother,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Aleck, you must stay here one moment
until I bring the ladder. I can let myself
down from this little window, but cannot carry
you. Stand close to it, dear boy, and do not
be frightened.'</p>

<p>"Stretching out from the window, he contrived
to reach an old worn-out leader which
would scarcely bear his weight, and to slide
thence to the ground. Raising the cry of
'Fire!' he ran for the ladder, which should
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
have been in its place on the other side of
the barn. It was not there. Frantic with
terror, as he saw what headway the fire was
making, he rushed from place to place in
search of the missing ladder; but all in vain;
it could not be found. Meanwhile his cries
had brought his aunt and the old cook from
the house. Henry ran back beneath the window
of the little room where he had left Aleck,
and called to him to jump down into his arms,
as it was the only chance of safety left. But,
alas, there was no answer; the poor little boy
had fainted from fright. Back to the door at
the foot of the stairs, which were now all in a
blaze, through which he was about to rush,
when his aunt's hand held him back.</p>

<p>"'Live for your father and mother. <i>I</i> have
<i>none</i> to live for.'</p>

<p>"With these words, she threw her dress over
her head, and dashing up the burning stairs,
was the next moment lost to sight. Two minutes
later, her voice was heard at the window.
In her arms she held the senseless Aleck, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
when Henry and the old cook stood beneath,
she called to them to catch him in their arms.
It was done; Aleck was safe. And then letting
herself from the window by her hands,
she fell upon the ground beside him scarcely
a moment before the flames burst upward
through the floor. Aleck was quite unhurt,
but his aunt was badly burned on one hand
and arm. She insisted, however, upon sitting
up and watching him, as he was feverish and
ill from fright. Late in the night Henry
awoke, and, opening his eyes, saw his aunt
kneeling by the side of the bed, and heard her
thanking God that he had given her this
child's life, beseeching him, oh, so earnestly,
that it might be the means of turning his
young heart towards her, that there might be
some one in the world to love her. Will you
wonder if after this Henry felt as if he could
never be patient or forbearing enough with
this poor unhappy lady?"</p>

<p>"But what made her so unhappy, papa, and
why were the boys so afraid of her?" asked
Maggie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, dear, I must say that it was her violent
temper, and her wish to control every
one about her, which made her so much feared
not only by the boys, but by all who lived with
her. But perhaps when I tell you a little
more, you will think with me that there was
much excuse for her.</p>

<p>"She was the only daughter and youngest
child in a large family of boys. Her mother
died when she was a very little baby, so that
she was left to grow up without that tenderest
and wisest of all care. Her father and brothers
loved her dearly; but I am afraid they indulged
and spoiled her too much. She had a
warm, generous, loving heart, but she was
very passionate, and would sometimes give
way to the most violent fits of temper. The
poor child had no one to tell her how foolish
and sinful this was, or to warn her that she
was laying up trouble for herself and her
friends, for her father would never suffer her
to be contradicted or corrected."</p>

<p>"Papa," said Bessie, as her father paused
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
for a moment, "do you mean the story of this
passionate child for a lesson to me?"</p>

<p>"No, darling," said her father; "for I
think my Bessie is learning, with God's help,
to control her quick temper so well that we
may hope it will not give her much trouble
when she is older. It is not for you more
than for your brothers and sister. But I have
a reason for wishing you all to see that it was
more the misfortune than the fault of the little
Henrietta that she grew up with an ungoverned
will and violent temper. Whatever she
wanted was given without any thought for the
rights or wishes of others; so it was not
strange if she soon came to consider that her
will was law and that she must have her own
way in all things. Perhaps those who had
the care of her did not know the harm they
were doing; but certain it is, that this poor
child was suffered to grow up into a most self-willed
woman."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry for her," said Bessie,
"'cause she did not have such wise people as
mine to tell her what was yight."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, she was much to be pitied. But
you must not think that this little girl was
always naughty; it was not so by any means.
And in spite of the faults which were never
checked, she was generally very bright, engaging,
and sweet. As she grew older, she
became more reasonable, and as every one
around her lived only for her pleasure, and
she had all she desired, it was not difficult for
her to keep her temper under control. It is
easy to be good when one is happy.</p>

<p>"This picture, which shows you how very
lovely she was, was taken for her father about
the time of her marriage, and was said to be
an excellent likeness. Soon after this, she
went to Europe with her husband and father.
There she passed several delightful months,
travelling from place to place, with these two
whom she loved so dearly.</p>

<p>"But now trouble, such as she had never
dreamed of, came to this poor girl. They
were in Switzerland, and one bright, sunny
day, when no one thought of a storm, her husband
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
and father went out in a small boat on
the Lake of Geneva. There sometimes arises
over this lake a terrible north-east wind,
which comes up very suddenly and blows with
great violence, causing the waves to rise to a
height which would be thought almost impossible
by one who had not seen it. For some
reason Henrietta had not gone with the two
gentlemen, but when she knew it was time for
them to be coming in, she went down to the
shore to meet them. She soon saw the boat
skimming along, and could almost distinguish
the faces of the two dear ones for whom she
was watching, when this terrible wind came
sweeping down over the water. She saw them
as they struggled against it, trying with all
their strength to reach the shore; but in vain.
Wave after wave rolled into the little boat,
and before many minutes it sank. Henrietta
stood upon the shore, and as she stretched out
her helpless hands toward them, saw her husband
and father drown. Do you wonder that
the sight drove her frantic? That those who
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
stood beside her could scarcely prevent her
from throwing herself into those waters which
covered all she loved best? Then came a
long and terrible illness, during which that
dark hair changed to snowy white."</p>

<p>"Papa," said Bessie, whose tender little
heart could not bear to hear of trouble or distress
which she could not comfort,&mdash;"papa, I
don't like this story; it is too mournful."</p>

<p>"I have almost done with this part of it,
dear," said her father, "and I tell it to you
that you may know how much need this poor
woman had that others should be kind and
patient with her, and how much excuse there
was for her when all this sorrow and trouble
made her irritable and impatient.</p>

<p>"Her brother came for her and took her
home, but not one of her friends could make
her happy or contented; for this poor lady
did not know where to turn for the best of all
comfort, and she had no strength of her own
to lean upon. So the faults of temper and
disposition, which had been passed over when
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
she was young and happy, now grew worse
and worse, making her so irritable and cross,
so self-willed and determined, that it was almost
impossible to live with her. Then for
years she was a great sufferer, and besides all
this, other troubles came upon her,&mdash;the loss
of a great part of her fortune through one
whom she had trusted, and various other trials.
So by degrees she drove one after another
of her friends from her, until she
seemed to stand quite alone in the world, and
to be, as she said, 'without any one to care
for her.'"</p>

<p>"Did not Aleck love her after the fire?"
asked Bessie.</p>

<p>"I think he was very grateful to her, dear,
but I am afraid he never became very fond of
her. He was a gentle, timid little fellow,
and though his aunt was never harsh to him,
it used to frighten him to see her severity with
other people."</p>

<p>"I'd have loved her, even if she was cross,"
said Maggie, looking again at the picture.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
"I'd have been so good to her that she
couldn't be unkind to me, and if she had
scolded me a little, I wouldn't have minded,
because I'd have been so sorry for her."</p>

<p>"Oh, Midget," said Harry, "you would
have been frightened out of your wits at her
first cross word."</p>

<p>"No, I wouldn't, Harry; and I would try
to be patient, even if she scolded me like&mdash;like
Aunt Patty."</p>

<p>"And what if she was Aunt Patty?" said
Fred.</p>

<p>"But then she wasn't, you know."</p>

<p>"But she was," said papa, smiling.</p>

<p>Maggie and Bessie opened their eyes very
wide at this astonishing news.</p>

<p>"You said her name was Henrietta, papa,"
said Maggie.</p>

<p>"Aunt Patty's name is also Henrietta," replied
Mr. Bradford, "and when she was young,
she was generally called so."</p>

<p>"And Henry was this Henry, our own
papa," said Fred, laying his hand on his father's
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
shoulder. "And Aleck was Uncle Alexander,
who died so long ago, before any of
us were born. I guessed it at the beginning."</p>

<p>"Well, now," said Mr. Bradford, "if Aunt
Patty comes to us by and by, and is not always
as gentle as she might be, will my little
children remember how much she has had to
try her, and how much there is in her which
is really good and unselfish?"</p>

<p>The boys promised readily enough, and Bessie
said doubtfully that she would try, but
when papa turned to Maggie, she looked as
shy and frightened as if Aunt Patty herself
had asked the question.</p>

<p>"What is my rosebud afraid of?" said Mr.
Bradford.</p>

<p>"Papa," said Maggie, "I'm so sorry for that
pretty lady, but I can't be sorry for Aunt
Patty,&mdash;and oh, papa, I&mdash;I&mdash;do wish&mdash;Aunt
Patty wasn't"&mdash;and poor Maggie broke
down in a desperate fit of crying.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Mr. Bradford feared that his story had been
almost in vain so far as his little girls were
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
concerned, and indeed it was so. They could
not make the pretty lady in the picture, the
poor young wife whose husband and father
had been drowned before her very eyes, or
the brave, generous woman who had saved
little Aleck, one and the same with the
dreaded Aunt Patty. The mischief which
words had done words could not so easily
undo.</p>

hristmas with all its pleasures had
come and gone, enjoyed perhaps as
much by the policeman's children as
it was by the little Bradfords in their wealthier
home. For though the former had not the
means of the latter with which to make merry,
they had contented spirits and grateful hearts,
and these go far to make people happy. Their
tall Christmas-tree and beautiful greens were
not more splendid in the eyes of Maggie and
Bessie than were the scanty wreath and two
foot high cedar branch, which a good-natured
market-woman had given Mrs. Granby, were
in those of little Jennie Richards. To be sure,
the apology for a tree was not dressed with
glittering balls, rich bonbons, or rows of tapers;
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
its branches bore no expensive toys, rare
books, or lovely pictures; but the owner and
the little ones for whose delight she dressed it,
were quite satisfied, and only pitied those who
had no tree at all. Had not good Mrs. Granby
made the most extraordinary flowers of red
flannel and gilt paper,&mdash;flowers whose likeness
never grew in gardens or greenhouses of any
known land; had she not baked sugar cakes
which were intended to represent men and
women, pigs, horses, and cows? Were not
the branches looped with gay ribbons? Did
they not bear rosy-cheeked apples, an orange
for each child, some cheap but much prized
toys, and, better than all, several useful and
greatly needed articles, which had been the
gift of Mrs. Bradford? What did it matter if
one could scarcely tell the pigs from the men?</p>

<p>Perhaps you may like to know how Mrs.
Bradford became interested in the policeman's
family.</p>

<p>One morning, a day or two before Christmas,
Maggie and Bessie were playing baby-house
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
in their own little room, when they
heard a knock at mamma's door. Maggie ran
to open it. There stood a woman who looked
rather poor, but neat and respectable. Maggie
was a little startled by the unexpected
sight of a strange face, and stood holding the
door without speaking.</p>

<p>"Your ma sent me up here," said the
woman. "She is busy below, and she told
me to come up and wait for her here."</p>

<p>So Maggie allowed the stranger to pass her,
and she took a chair which stood near the
door. Maggie saw that she looked very cold,
but had not the courage to ask her to come
nearer the fire. After a moment, the woman
smiled pleasantly. Maggie did not return the
smile, though she looked as if she had half
a mind to do so; but she did not like to see
the woman looking so uncomfortable, and
pushing a chair close to the fire, she said,
"There."</p>

<p>The woman did not move; perhaps she, too,
felt a little shy in a strange place. Maggie
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
was rather vexed that she did not understand
her without more words, but summing up all
her courage, she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think if you took this seat by the fire,
you'd be warmer." The woman thanked her,
and took the chair, looking quite pleased.</p>

<p>"Are you the little lady who was lost a
couple of months ago?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No," said Maggie, at once interested,
"that was our Bessie; but we found her
again."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know that. I heard all about
her from Policeman Richards, who looked after
her when she was up to the station."</p>

<p>"Bessie, Bessie!" called Maggie, "here's
a woman that knows your station policeman.
Come and look at her."</p>

<p>At this, Bessie came running from the inner
room.</p>

<p>"Well," said the woman, laughing heartily,
"it is nice to be looked at for the sake of one's
friends when one is not much to look at for
one's self."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think you're pretty much to look at,"
said Bessie. "I think you have a nice, pleasant
face. How is my policeman?"</p>

<p>"He's well," said the stranger. "And so
you call him your policeman; do you? Well,
I shall just tell him that; I've a notion it will
tickle him a bit."</p>

<p>"He's one of my policemen," said Bessie.
"I have three,&mdash;one who helps us over the
crossing; the one who found me when I came
lost; and the one who was so good to me in
his station-house."</p>

<p>"And that is my friend, Sergeant Richards.
Well, he's a mighty nice fellow."</p>

<p>"Yes, he is," said Bessie, "and I'd like to
see him again. Are you his wife, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"Bless you, no!" said the woman; "I am
nothing but Mrs. Granby, who lives in his
house. Your grandmother, Mrs. Stanton,
sent me to your ma, who, she said, had work
to give me. His poor wife, she can scarce
creep about the room, let alone walking
this far. Not but that she's better than she
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
was a spell back, and she'd be spryer yet, I
think, but for the trouble that's weighin' on
her all the time, and hinders her getting
well."</p>

<p>"Does she have a great deal of trouble?"
asked Maggie, who by this time felt quite sociable.</p>

<p>"Doesn't she though!" answered Mrs.
Granby. "Trouble enough; and she's awful
bad herself with the rheumatics, and a sickly
baby, and a blind boy, and debts to pay, and
that scandal of a doctor, and no way of laying
up much; for the children must be fed and
warmed, bless their hearts! and a police-sergeant's
pay ain't no great; yes, yes, honey,
lots of trouble and no help for it as I see.
Not that I tell them so; I just try to keep up
their hearts."</p>

<p>"Why don't they tell Jesus about their
troubles, and ask him to help them?" asked
Bessie, gently.</p>

<p>"So they do," answered Mrs. Granby; "but
he hasn't seen best to send them help yet. I
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
suppose he'll just take his own time and his
own way to do it; at least, that's what Sergeant
Richards says. He'll trust the Lord,
and wait on him, he says; but it's sore waiting
sometimes. Maybe all this trouble is sent
to try his faith, and I can say it don't fail him,
so far as I can see. But, honey, I guess you
sometimes pray yourself; so to-night, when
you go to bed, do you say a bit of a prayer for
your friend, Sergeant Richards. I believe a
heap in the prayers of the young and innocent;
and you just ask the Lord to help him out of
this trouble. Maybe he'll hear you; anyway,
it won't do no harm; prayer never hurt
nobody."</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma!" exclaimed Bessie, as her
mother just then entered the room, "what do
you think? This very nice woman lives with
my station policeman, who was so kind to me,
and his name is Yichards, and he has a lame
baby and a sick wife and a blind boy, and no
doctor to pay, and the children must be fed,
and a great deal of trouble, and she don't get
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
well because of it, and he does have trust in
the Lord, but he hasn't helped him yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And my Bessie's tongue has run away
with her ideas," said mamma, laughing.
"What is all this about, little one?"</p>

<p>"About Bessie's policeman," said Maggie,
almost as eager as her sister. "Let this
woman tell you. She knows him very well."</p>

<p>"I beg pardon, ma'am," said Mrs. Granby.
"I don't know but it was my tongue ran away
with me, and I can't say it's not apt to do so;
but when your little daughter was lost, it was
my friend, Sergeant Richards, that saw to her
when she was up to the station, and he's
talked a deal about her, for he was mighty
taken with her."</p>

<p>"Bessie told me how kind he was to her,"
said Mrs. Bradford.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am; there isn't a living thing
that he wouldn't be kind to, and it does pass
me to know what folks like him are so afflicted
for. However, it's the Lord's work, and I've
no call to question his doings. But the little
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
ladies were just asking me about Sergeant
Richards, ma'am, and so I came to tell them
what a peck of troubles he was in."</p>

<p>"What are they, if you are at liberty to
speak of them?" asked Mrs. Bradford.
"Any one who has been kind to my children
has a special claim on me."</p>

<p>So Mrs. Granby told the story, not at all
with the idea of asking aid for her friends,&mdash;that
she knew the good policeman and his
wife would not like,&mdash;but, as she afterwards
told them, because she could not help it.
"The dear lady looked so sweet, and spoke so
sweet, now and then asking a question, not
prying like, but as if she took a real interest,
not listening as if it were a duty or because
she was ashamed to interrupt. And she
wasn't of the kind to tell you there was others
worse off than you, or that your troubles
might be greater than they were. If there's
a thing that aggravates me, it's that," continued
Mrs. Granby. "I know I ought to be
thankful, and so I mostly am, that I and my
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
friends ain't no worse off than we are, and I
know it's no good to be frettin' and worryin'
about your trials, and settin' yourself against
the Lord's will; but I do say if I fall down
and break my arm, there ain't a grain of comfort
in hearin' that my next-door neighbor
has broken both his. Quite contrary; I think
mine pains worse for thinkin' how his must
hurt him. And now that I can't do the fine
work I used to, it don't make it no easier for
me to get my livin' to have it said, as a lady
did to me this morning, that it would be far
worse if I was blind. So it would, I don't
gainsay that, but it don't help my seeing, to
have it thrown up to me by people that has
the full use of their eyes. Mrs. Bradford
aint none of that sort, though, not she; and
the children, bless their hearts, stood listenin'
with all their ears, and I'd scarce done when
the little one broke out with,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Oh, do help them! Mamma, couldn't
you help them?'</p>

<p>"But I could see the mother was a bit
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
backward about offerin' help, thinkin', I
s'pose, that you and Mary wasn't used to charity,
and not knowin' how you'd take it; so
she puts it on the plea of its bein' Christmas
time."</p>

<p>And here Mrs. Granby paused, having at
last talked herself out of breath.</p>

<p>All this was true. Mrs. Bradford had felt
rather delicate about offering assistance to the
policeman's family, not knowing but that it
might give offence. But when she had arranged
with Mrs. Granby about the work, she
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Since your friends are so pressed just now,
I suppose they have not been able to make
much preparation for Christmas."</p>

<p>"Precious little, ma'am," answered Mrs.
Granby; "for Sergeant Richards don't think
it right to spend a penny he can help when
he's owin' others. But we couldn't let the
children quite forget it was Christmas, so I'm
just goin' to make them a few cakes, and get
up some small trifles that will please them.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
I'd have done more, only this last week, when
I hadn't much work, I was fixin' up some of
the children's clothes, for Mrs. Richards, poor
soul, can't set a stitch with her cramped fingers,
and there was a good deal of lettin' out
and patchin' to be done."</p>

<p>"And how are the children off for
clothes?" asked Mrs. Bradford.</p>

<p>"Pretty tolerable, the boys, ma'am, for I've
just made Willie a suit out of an old uniform
of his father's, and the little ones' clothes get
handed down from one to another, though
they don't look too fine neither. But Jennie,
poor child, has taken a start to grow these
last few months, and I couldn't fix a thing for
her she wore last winter. So she's wearin'
her summer calicoes yet, and even them are
very short as to the skirts, and squeezed as to
the waists, which ain't good for a growin'
child."</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Bradford, smiling. "I
have here a couple of merino dresses of Maggie's,
and a warm sack, which she has outgrown.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
They are too good to give to any one
who would not take care of them, and I laid
them aside until I should find some one to
whom they would be of use. Do you think
Mrs. Richards would be hurt if I offered them
to her? They will at least save some
stitches."</p>

<p>"Indeed, ma'am," said Mrs. Granby, her
eyes dancing, "you needn't be afraid; she'll
be only too glad and thankful, and it was only
this mornin' she was frettin' about Jennie's
dress. She ain't quite as cheery as her husband,
poor soul; 'taint to be expected she
should be, and she always had a pride in Jennie's
looks, but there didn't seem no way to
get a new thing for one of the children this
winter."</p>

<p>"And here is a cap of Franky's, and some
little flannel shirts, which I will roll up in the
bundle," said Mrs. Bradford. "They may,
also, be of use."</p>

<p>Away rushed Maggie when she heard this
to her own room, coming back with a china
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
dog and a small doll, which she thrust into
Mrs. Granby's hands, begging her to take
them to Jennie, but to be sure not to give
them to her before Christmas morning.</p>

<p>"What shall we do for the blind boy?"
asked Bessie. "We want to make him
happy."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he would like a book," said
mamma.</p>

<p>"But he couldn't see to read it, mamma."</p>

<p>"Oh, I dare say some one would read it to
him," said Mrs. Bradford. "Does he not like
that?" she asked of Mrs. Granby.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am. His mother reads to him
mostly all the time when the baby is quiet.
It's about all she can do, and it's his greatest
pleasure, dear boy, to have her read out the
books he and Jennie get at Sunday-school
every Sunday."</p>

<p>"Can he go to Sunday-school when he's
blind?" asked Maggie.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, honey. Every Sunday mornin'
there's a big boy that goes to the same school
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
stops for Willie and Jennie, and totes them
with him; and if their father or me can't go
to church, he just totes them back after service.
And when Willie comes in with his
libr'y book and his 'Child's Paper' and Scripture
text, he's as rich as a king, and a heap
more contented, I guess."</p>

<p>While Mrs. Granby was talking, Mrs. Bradford
was looking over a parcel which contained
some new books, and now she gave her one for
blind Willie's Christmas gift, saying she hoped
things would be ordered so that before another
Christmas he would be able to see.</p>

<p>There is no need to tell Mrs. Granby's delight,
or the thanks which she poured out.
If Mrs. Bradford had given her a most magnificent
present for herself, it would not have
pleased her half so much as did these trifles
for the policeman's children.</p>

<p>That evening, after the little ones were all
in bed, Mrs. Granby told Mr. Richards and
his wife of all that had happened at Mrs.
Bradford's.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Richards was by no means too proud
to accept the lady's kindness; so pleased was
she to think that she should see Jennie warm
and neat once more that she had no room in
her heart for anything but gratitude.</p>

<p>Mrs. Granby was just putting away the
treasures she had been showing, when there
came a rap from the old-fashioned knocker
on the front-door.</p>

<p>"Sit you still, Sergeant Richards," she
said. "I'm on my feet, and I'll just open the
door." Which she did, and saw a tall gentleman
standing there, who asked if Mr. Richards
was in. "He is, sir," she answered, and
then saying to herself, "I hope he's got special
business for him that he'll pay him well
for," threw open the door of the sitting-room,
and asked the gentleman in.</p>

<p>But the police-sergeant had already done
the "special business," for which the gentleman
came to make return. Mr. Richards
knew him by sight, though he had never
spoken to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Bradford, I believe, sir?" he said,
coming forward.</p>

<p>"You know me then?" said the gentleman.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered Richards, placing a
chair for his visitor. "You see I know many
as don't know me. Can I be of any service
to you, sir?"</p>

<p>"I came to have a talk with you, if you are
at leisure," said Mr. Bradford. "Perhaps
you may think I am taking a liberty, but my
wife heard to-day, through your friend, that
you were in some trouble with a doctor who
has attended your family, and that you have
been disappointed in obtaining the services of
Mr. Ray, who has gone to Europe. I am a
lawyer, you know, and if you do not object to
consider me as a friend in his place, perhaps
you will let me know what your difficulties
are, and I may be able to help you."</p>

<p>The policeman looked gratefully into the
frank, noble face before him. "Thank you,
sir," he said; "you are very good, and this
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
is not the first time that I have heard of your
kindness to those in trouble. It's rather a
long story, that of our difficulties, but if it
won't tire you, I'll be thankful to tell it."</p>

<p>He began far back, telling how they had
done well, and been very comfortable, having
even a little laid by, until about a year since,
when Mrs. Richards' father and mother, who
lived with them, had died within a month of
each other.</p>

<p>"And I couldn't bear, sir," he said, "that
the old folks shouldn't have a decent burying.
So that used up what we had put by for a
rainy day. Maybe I was foolish, but you see
they were Mary's people, and we had feeling
about it. But sure enough, no sooner was
the money gone than the rainy day came, and
stormy enough it has been ever since."</p>

<p>He went on, telling how sickness had come,
one thing following another; how Dr. Schwitz
had promised that his charges should be small,
but how he never would give in his bill, the
policeman and his wife thinking all the while
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
that it was kindness which kept him from doing
so; how it had taken every cent of his salary
to pay the other expenses of illness, and
keep the family barely warmed and fed; of
the disappointment of their hopes for Willie
for, at least, some time to come; and finally
of the terrible bill which Dr. Schwitz had sent
through revenge, the police-sergeant thought,
and upon the prompt payment of which he
was now insisting.</p>

<p>"He's hard on me, sir, after all his fair
promises," said Richards, as he handed Mr.
Bradford the bill; "and you see he has me, for
I made no agreement with him, and I don't
know as I can rightly say that the law would
not allow it to him; so, for that reason, I don't
dare to dispute it. But I thought Mr. Ray
might be able to make some arrangement
with him, and I <i>can't</i> pay it all at once, nor
this long time yet, that's settled. If he would
wait, I might clear it off in a year or two
though how then we are to get bread to put
into the children's mouths I don't see. And
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
there is the rent to pay, you know. We have
tucked the children and Mrs. Granby all into
one room, and let out the other two up-stairs;
so that's a little help. And Mary was talking
of selling that mahogany table and bookcase
that are as dear to her as if they were gold,
for they were her mother's; but they won't
fetch nothing worth speaking of. The English
colonel that came after your little daughter,
when she was up at the station that day, was
so good as to hand me a ten dollar bill, and
we laid that by for a beginning; but think
what a drop in the bucket that is, and it's precious
little that we've added to it. I don't
see my way out of this; that's just a fact, sir,
and my only hope is that the Lord knows all."</p>

<p>"You say Dr. Schwitz tried to bribe you by
saying he would send in no bill, if you allowed
his nephew to escape?" said Mr. Bradford.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and I suppose I might use that
for a handle against him; but I don't like to,
for I can't say but that the man was real kind
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
to me and mine before that. If he presses me
too hard, I may have to; but I can't bear to
do it."</p>

<p>"Will you put the matter in my hands, and
let me see this Dr. Schwitz?" asked Mr.
Bradford.</p>

<p>Richards was only too thankful, and after
asking a little more about blind Willie, the
gentleman took his leave.</p>

<p>There is no need to tell what he said to Dr.
Schwitz, but a few days after he saw the police-sergeant
again, and gave him a new bill,
which was just half as much as the former
one, with the promise that the doctor would
wait and allow Richards to pay it by degrees,
on condition that it was done within the year.
This, by great pinching and saving, the policeman
thought he would be able to do. The
good gentleman did not tell that it was only
by paying part of the sum himself that he had
been able to make this arrangement.</p>

<p>"I don't know what claim I have upon you
for such kindness, sir," said Richards, "but if
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
you knew what a load you have taken from
me, I am sure you would feel repaid."</p>

<p>"I am repaid, more than repaid," said Mr.
Bradford, with a smile; "for I feel that I am
only paying a debt."</p>

<p>The policeman looked surprised.</p>

<p>"You were very kind to my little girl when
she was in trouble," said the gentleman.</p>

<p>"Oh, that, sir? Who could help it? And
that was a very tiny seed to bring forth such
a harvest as this."</p>

<p>"It was 'bread cast upon the waters,'"
said Mr. Bradford, "and to those who give in
the Lord's name, he gives again 'good measure,
pressed down, shaken together, and running
over.'"</p>

<p class="pmb3">But the policeman had not even yet gathered
in the whole of his harvest.</p>

hristmas brought no Uncle Ruthven,
but Christmas week brought
Miss Elizabeth Rush, the sweet "Aunt
Bessie" whom all the children loved so
dearly. And it was no wonder they were
fond of her, for she was almost as gentle and
patient with them as mamma herself; and,
like her brother, the colonel, had a most wonderful
gift of story-telling, which she was always
ready to put in use for them. Maggie
and Bessie were more than ever sure that
there were never such delightful people as
their own, or two such happy children as
themselves.</p>

<p>"I think we're the completest family that
ever lived," said Maggie, looking around the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
room with great satisfaction, one evening
when Colonel and Mrs. Rush were present.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bessie; "I wonder somebody
don't write a book about us."</p>

<p>"And call it 'The Happy Family,'" said
Fred, mischievously, "after those celebrated
bears and dogs and cats and mice who live together
in the most peaceable manner so long
as they have no teeth and claws, but who
immediately fall to and eat one another up as
soon as these are allowed to grow."</p>

<p>"If there is a bear among us, it must
be yourself, sir," said the colonel, playfully
pinching Fred's ear.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Fred, rubbing the
ear; "judging from your claws, I should say
you were playing that character, colonel;
while I shall have to take that of the unlucky
puppy who has fallen into your clutches."</p>

<p>"I am glad you understand yourself so
well, any way," returned Colonel Rush, drily.</p>

<p>Fred and the colonel were very fond of joking
and sparring in this fashion, but Bessie always
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
looked very sober while it was going on;
for she could not bear anything that sounded
like disputing, even in play; and perhaps she
was about right.</p>

<p>But all this had put a new idea into that
busy little brain of Maggie's. "Bessie," she
said, the next morning, "I have a secret
to tell you, and you must not tell any one
else."</p>

<p>"Not mamma?" asked Bessie.</p>

<p>"No, we'll tell mamma we have a secret,
and we'll let her know by and by; but I want
her to be very much surprised as well as the
rest of the people. Bessie, I'm going to
write a book, and you may help me, if you
like."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Bessie. "And what will it be
about, Maggie?"</p>

<p>"About ourselves. You put it in my head
to do it, Bessie. But then I sha'n't put in our
real names, 'cause I don't want people to
know it is us. I made up a name last night.
I shall call my people the Happys."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>"And shall you call the book 'The Happy
Family'?" asked Bessie.</p>

<p>"No; I think we will call it 'The Complete
Family,'" said Maggie. "That sounds nicer
and more booky; don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bessie, looking at her sister
with great admiration. "And when are you
going to begin it?"</p>

<p>"To-day," said Maggie. "I'll ask mamma
for some paper, and I'll write some every day
till it's done; and then I'll ask papa to take it
to the bookmaker; and when the book is
made, we'll sell it, and give the money to the
poor. I'll tell you what, Bessie, if Policeman
Richards' blind boy is not cured by then,
we'll give it to him to pay his doctor."</p>

<p>"You dear Maggie!" said Bessie. "Will
you yite a piece that I make up about yourself?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Maggie; "I'll see
what you say. I wouldn't like people to
know it was me."</p>

<p class="pmb1">The book was begun that very day, but it
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
had gone little farther than the title and chapter
first, before they found they should be
obliged to take mamma into the secret at
once. There were so many long words which
they wished to use, but which they did not
know how to spell, that they saw they would
have to be running to her all the time. To
their great delight, mamma gave Maggie a
new copy-book to write in, and they began
again. As this was a stormy day, they could
not go out, so they were busy a long while over
their book. When, at last, Maggie's fingers
were tired, and it was put away, it contained
this satisfactory beginning:&mdash;</p>


<div class="block1">
<p class="center font12">&quot;THE COMPLETE FAMILY.</p>

<p class="center font09">&quot;A TALE OF HISTORY.</p>

<p class="center">&quot;<span class="smcap">Chapter I.</span></p>

<p>&quot;Once upon a time, there lived a family
named Happy; only that was not their real
name, and you wish you had known them,
and they are alive yet, because none of them
have died. This was the most interesting and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
happiest family that ever lived. And God
was so very good to them that they ought to
have been the best family; but they were not
except only the father and mother; and sometimes
they were naughty, but 'most always
afterwards they repented, so God forgave
them.</p>

<p class="pmb1">&quot;This family were very much acquainted
with some very great friends of theirs, and
the colonel was very brave, and his leg was
cut off; but now he is going to get a new leg,
only it is a make believe.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>This was all that was done the first day;
and that evening a very wonderful and delightful
thing occurred, which Maggie thought
would make her book more interesting than
ever.</p>

<p>There had been quite a family party at dinner,
for it was Aunt Bessie's birthday, and
the colonel and Mrs. Rush were always considered
as belonging to the family now. Besides
these, there were grandmamma and Aunt
Annie, Grandpapa Duncan, Uncle John, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
Aunt Helen, all assembled to do honor to
Aunt Bessie.</p>

<p>Dinner was over, and all, from grandpapa to
baby, were gathered in the parlor, when there
came a quick, hard pull at the door-bell.
Two moments later, the parlor door was
thrown open, and there stood a tall, broad
figure in a great fur overcoat, which, as well
as his long, curly beard, was thickly powdered
with snow. At the first glance, he looked,
except in size, not unlike the figure which a
few weeks since had crowned their Christmas-tree;
and in the moment of astonished silence
which followed, Franky, throwing back his
head and clapping his hands, shouted, "Santy
Caus, Santy Caus!"</p>

<p>But it was no Santa Claus, and in spite of
the muffling furs and the heavy beard, in
spite of all the changes which ten long years
of absence had made, the mother's heart, and
the mother's eye knew her son, and rising
from her seat with a low cry of joy, Mrs. Stanton
stretched her hands towards the stranger,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
exclaiming, "My boy! Ruthven, my boy!"
and the next moment she was sobbing in his
arms. Then his sisters were clinging about
him, and afterwards followed such a kissing
and hand-shaking!</p>

<p class="pmb2">It was an evening of great joy and excitement,
and although it was long past the usual
time when Maggie and Bessie went to bed,
they could not go to sleep. At another time
nurse would have ordered them to shut their
eyes and not speak another word; but to-night
she seemed to think it quite right and
natural that they should be so very wide
awake, and not only gave them an extra
amount of petting and kissing, but told them
stories of Uncle Ruthven's pranks when he
was a boy, and of his wonderful sayings and
doings, till mamma, coming up and finding
this going on, was half inclined to find fault
with the old woman herself. Nurse had quite
forgotten that, in those days, she told Uncle
Ruthven, as she now told Fred, that he was
"the plague of her life," and that he "worried
her heart out." Perhaps she did not really
mean it with the one more than with the
other.</p>

<p class="pmb2" />


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>"And to think of him," she said, wiping
the tears of joy from her eyes,&mdash;"to think of
him asking for his old mammy 'most before he
had done with his greetings to the gentlefolks!
And him putting his arm about me
and giving me a kiss as hearty as he used
when he was a boy; and him been all over
the world seein' all sorts of sights and doin's.
The Lord bless him! He's got just the same
noble, loving heart, if he has got all that hair
about his face."</p>

<p>Uncle Ruthven's tremendous beard was a
subject of great astonishment to all the children.
Fred saucily asked him if he had come
home to set up an upholsterer's shop, knowing
he could himself furnish plenty of stuffing
for mattresses and sofas. To which his uncle
replied that when he did have his beard cut,
it should be to furnish a rope to bind Fred's
hands and feet with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>Maggie was very eager to write down the
account of Uncle Ruthven's home-coming in
her history of "The Complete Family," and as
mamma's time was more taken up than usual
just now, she could not run to her so often for
help in her spelling. So the next two days
a few mistakes went down, and the story ran
after this fashion:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Happys had a very happy thing happen
to them witch delited them very much.
They had a travelling uncle who came home
to them at last; but he staid away ten years
and did not come home even to see his mother,
and I think he ort to don't you? But now
he is come and has brought so many trunks
and boxes with such lots and lots of things
and kurositys in them that he is 'most like a
Norz' Ark only better, and his gret coat and
cap are made of the bears' skins he shot and
he tells us about the tigers and lions and I
don't like it and Fred and Harry do and Bessie
don't too. And he is so nice and he
brought presents for every boddy and nurse
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
a shawl that she's going to keep in her will till
she dies for Harry's wife, and he has not any
and says he won't because Uncle Ruthven has
no wife. That is all to-day my fingers are
krampd."</p>

<p>Strange to say, Maggie was at home with the
new uncle much sooner than Bessie. Little
Bessie was not quite sure that she altogether
approved of Uncle Ruthven, or that it was
quite proper for this stranger to come walking
into the house and up-stairs at all hours of the
day, kissing mamma, teasing nurse, and playing
and joking with the children, just as if he
had been at home there all his life. Neither
would she romp with him as the other children
did, looking gravely on from some quiet corner
at their merry frolics, as if she half-disapproved
of it all. So Uncle Ruthven nicknamed
her the "Princess," and always called
her "your highness" and "your grace," at
which Bessie did not know whether to be
pleased or displeased. She even looked half-doubtfully
at the wonderful stories he told,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
though she never lost a chance of hearing one.
Uncle Ruthven was very fond of children,
though he was not much accustomed to them,
and he greatly enjoyed having them with him,
telling Mrs. Bradford that he did not know
which he liked best,&mdash;Bessie with her dainty,
quiet, ladylike little ways, or Maggie with
her half-shy, half-roguish manner, and love of
fun and mischief. Maggie and all the boys
were half wild about him, and as for baby, if
she could have spoken, she would have said
that never was there such an uncle for jumping
and tossing. The moment she heard his
voice, her hands and feet began to dance, and
took no rest till he had her in his arms;
while mamma sometimes feared the soft little
head and the ceiling might come to too close
an acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Princess," said Mr. Stanton, one evening,
when he had been home about a fortnight,
catching up Bessie, as she ran past him, and
seating her upon the table, "what is that
name your highness calls me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't call you anything but Uncle Yuthven,"
answered Bessie, gravely.</p>

<p>"That is it," said her uncle. "What becomes
of all your r's? Say Ruthven."</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;Yuthven," said Bessie,
trying very hard at the r.</p>

<p>Mr. Stanton shook his head and laughed.</p>

<p>"I can talk plainer than I used to," said
Bessie. "I used to call Aunt Bessie's name
very crooked, but I don't now."</p>

<p>"What did you use to call it?"</p>

<p>"I used to say <i>Libasus</i>; but now I can say
it plain, <i>Lisabus</i>."</p>

<p>"A vast improvement, certainly," said Mr.
Stanton, "but you can't manage the R's yet,
hey? Well, they will come one of these days,
I suppose."</p>

<p>"They'd better," said Fred, who was hanging
over his uncle's shoulder, "or it will be a
nice thing when she is a young lady for her to
go turning all her R's into Y's. People will
call her crooked-tongued Miss Bradford."</p>

<p>"You don't make a very pleasant prospect
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
for me to be in," said Bessie, looking from
brother to uncle with grave displeasure, "and
if a little boy like you, Fred, says that to me
when I am a big lady, I shall say, 'My dear,
you are very impertinent.'"</p>

<p>"And quite right, too," said Uncle Ruthven.
"If all the little boys do not treat you
with proper respect, Princess, just bring them
to me, and I will teach them good manners."</p>

<p>Bessie made no answer, for she felt rather
angry, and, fearing she might say something
naughty, she wisely held her tongue; and
slipping from her uncle's hold, she slid to his
knee, and from that to the floor, running
away to Aunt Bessie for refuge.</p>

<p>After the children had gone to bed, Uncle
Ruthven went up to Mrs. Bradford's room,
that he might have a quiet talk with this his
favorite sister. Mrs. Bradford was rocking
her baby to sleep, which business was rather a
serious one, for not the least talking or moving
about could go on in the room but this
very young lady must have a share in it.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
The long lashes were just drooping upon the
round, dimpled cheek when Uncle Ruthven's
step was heard.</p>

<p>"Ah-oo-oo," said the little wide-awake,
starting up with a crow of welcome to the
playfellow she liked so well.</p>

<p>Mamma laid the little head down again,
and held up a warning finger to Uncle Ruthven,
who stole softly to a corner, where he was
out of Miss Baby's sight and hearing, to wait
till she should be fairly off to dreamland.
This brought him near the door of Maggie's
and Bessie's room, where, without intending
it, he heard them talking. Not hearing his
voice, they thought he had gone away again,
and presently Maggie said in a low tone, that
she might not rouse baby, "Bessie, have you
objections to Uncle Ruthven?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Bessie, slowly,&mdash;"yes,
Maggie, I think I have. I try not to, but
I'm 'fraid I do have a little objections to him."</p>

<p>"But why?" asked Maggie. "<i>I</i> think he
is lovely."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know," said Bessie. "But, Maggie,
don't you think he makes pretty intimate?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Maggie; "but then he's
our uncle, you know. I guess he has a right
if he has a mind to."</p>

<p>"But he makes more intimate than Uncle
John, and we've known him ever so long, and
Uncle Yuthven only a little while. Why,
Maggie, he kisses mamma!"</p>

<p>"Well, he is her own brother," said Maggie,
"and Uncle John is only her step-brother,&mdash;no,
that's not it&mdash;her brother-of-law&mdash;that's
it."</p>

<p>"What does that mean, Maggie?"</p>

<p>"It means when somebody goes and marries
your sister. If somebody married me,
he'd be your brother-of-law."</p>

<p>"He sha'n't!" said Bessie, quite excited.
"He's a horrid old thing, and he sha'n't do
it!"</p>

<p>"Who sha'n't do what?" asked Maggie,
rather puzzled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>"That person, that brother-of-law; he
sha'n't marry you; you are my own Maggie."</p>

<p>"Well, he needn't if you don't want him
to," said Maggie, quite as well contented to
settle it one way as the other. "And you
needn't feel so bad, and sit up in bed about it,
Bessie, 'cause you'll take cold, and mamma
forbid it."</p>

<p>"So she did," said Bessie, lying down again
with a sigh. "Maggie, I'm 'fraid I'm naughty
to-night. I forgot what mamma told me, and
I was naughty to Uncle Yuthven."</p>

<p>"What did you say?"</p>

<p>"I didn't <i>say</i> anything, but I felt very passionate,
and I thought naughty things,&mdash;how
I'd like to give him a good slap when he
teased me, and, Maggie, for a moment I 'most
thought I wished he did not come home. I
am going to tell him I'm sorry, the next time
he comes."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't," said Maggie, who was never
as ready as Bessie to acknowledge that she
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
had been wrong; "not if I didn't do or say
anything."</p>

<p>"I would," said Bessie. "It is naughty to
feel so; and you know there's no 'scuse for
me to be passionate like there was for Aunt
Patty, 'cause my people are so very wise, and
teach me better. And it grieves Jesus when
we feel naughty, and he saw my naughty heart
to-night."</p>

<p>"Then ask him to forgive you," said Maggie.</p>

<p>"So I did; but I think he'll know I want
to be better if I ask Uncle Yuthven too."</p>

<p>"Well," said Maggie, "maybe he will.
But, Bessie, why do you speak about yourself
as if you are like Aunt Patty. You're not a
bit like her."</p>

<p>"But I might be, if I wasn't teached better,"
said Bessie, "and if Jesus didn't help
me. Poor Aunt Patty! Papa said she was
to be pitied."</p>

<p>"I sha'n't pity her, I know," said Maggie.</p>

<p>"But, Maggie, mamma said we ought to
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
try and feel kind to her, and to be patient and
good to her when she came here, 'cause she's
getting very old, and there's nobody to love
her, or take care of her. I am 'fraid of her,
but I am sorry for her."</p>

<p>"If she has nobody to take care of her, let
her go to the Orphan Asylum," said Maggie.
"I just hope papa will send her there, 'cause
we don't want to be bothered with her."</p>

<p>"And don't you feel a bit sorry for her,
Maggie?"</p>

<p>"No, not a bit; and I'm not going to, either.
She is quite a disgrace to herself, and
so she'd better stay at her house up in the
mountains."</p>

<p>Maggie, in her turn, was growing quite excited,
as she always did when she talked or
thought of Aunt Patty. It was some time
since the children had done either, for Christmas,
Aunt Bessie, and Uncle Ruthven had
given them so much else to think about, that
they had almost forgotten there was such a
person.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>And now mamma, who had laid baby in
her cradle, coming in to stop the talking, was
sorry to hear her little girls speaking on the
old, disagreeable subject. She told them they
must be still, and go to sleep. The first command
was obeyed at once, but Maggie did not
find the second quite so easy; and she lay
awake for some time imagining all kinds of
possible and impossible quarrels with Aunt
Patty, and inventing a chapter about her for
"The Complete Family."</p>

<p>While little Maggie was thinking thus of
Aunt Patty, the old lady, in her far-away
home, was wondering how she might best contrive
to gain the hearts of her young nieces
and nephews, for she was not the same woman
she had been four years ago. During the last
few months a new knowledge and a new life
had come to her, making her wish to live in
peace and love with every one. But she did
not know how to set about this; for the poor
lady had grown old in the indulgence of a
bad temper, a proud spirit, and a habit of desiring
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
to rule all about her; and now it was
not easy to change all this. She had humbled
herself at the feet of her Lord and Saviour,
but it was hard work to do it before her fellow-men.
She could not quite resolve to say
to those whom she had grieved and offended
by her violence and self-will, "I have done
wrong, but now I see my sin, and wish, with
God's help, to lead a new life."</p>

<p>Still, she longed for the love and friendship
she had once cast from her, and her lonely
heart craved for some care and affection.
She well knew that Mr. and Mrs. Bradford
would be only too ready to forgive and forget
all that was disagreeable in the past, and she
also felt that they would do nothing to prejudice
the minds of their children against her.
She thought she would go to them, and try to
be gentle and loving, and so perhaps she
should win back their hearts, and gain those
of their little ones. But old habit and the old
pride were still strong within her, and so,
when she wrote to Mr. Bradford to say she
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
was coming to make them a visit, she gave no
sign that she was sorry for the past, and
would like to make amends.</p>

<p>But shortly before the time she had fixed
for the visit, something happened which
caused her to change her purpose, and she
chose to say nothing of her reasons for this,
only sending word that she could not come
before spring, perhaps not then. Now, again
she had altered her plans, and this time she
chose to take them all by surprise, and to go
to Mr. Bradford's without warning.</p>

<p>"Margaret," said Mr. Stanton softly, as his
sister came from the bedside of her little girls,
and they went to the other side of the room,
"what a sensitive conscience your darling little
Bessie has! It seems I vexed her to-night,
though I had no thought of doing so. I saw
she was displeased, but the feeling seemed to
pass in a moment. Now I find that she is so
penitent for indulging in even a wrong feeling
that she cannot rest satisfied without asking
pardon, not only of her heavenly Father, but
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
also of me." And he told Mrs. Bradford of
all he had heard the children say, with some
amusement, as he repeated the conversation
about himself.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Bradford, "my dear little
Bessie's quick temper gives her some trouble.
I am often touched to see her silent struggles
with herself when something tries it, how she
forces back each angry word and look, and
faithfully asks for the help which she knows
will never fail her. But with that tender
conscience, and her simple trust in Him who
has redeemed her, I believe all the strength
she needs will be granted. God only knows
how thankful I am that he has thus early led
my precious child to see the sin and evil of
a passionate and unchecked temper, and so
spared her and hers the misery which I have
seen it cause to others."</p>

<p>Uncle Ruthven came in the next morning,
and, as usual, "making intimate," ran up to
mamma's room. She was not there; but
Maggie and Bessie were, busy over "The
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
Complete Family." But Maggie did not look at
all as if she belonged to the Happys just then.
She had composed, what she thought, a very
interesting chapter about Aunt Patty, and
commenced it in this way: "There came to
the Happys a very great aflekshun." But
when she had written this last word, she had
her doubts about the spelling, and carried the
book to mamma to see if it were right. Mamma
inquired what the affliction was, and finding,
as she supposed, that it was Aunt Patty,
she told Maggie she did not wish her to write
about her. Maggie was very much disappointed,
and even pouted a little, and she had
not quite recovered when her uncle came in.
In his hand he carried a little basket of
flowers, which the children supposed was for
mamma, and which he stood upon the table.
Bessie loved flowers dearly, and in a moment
she was hanging over them, and enjoying
their sweetness.</p>

<p>Uncle Ruthven asked what they were
about, and to Bessie's surprise, Maggie took
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
him at once into the secret, telling him all
about "The Complete Family" and her present
trouble. Uncle Ruthven quite agreed
with mamma that it was not wisest and best
to write anything unkind of Aunt Patty, and
told Maggie of some very pleasant things she
might relate, so that presently she was smiling
and good-natured again.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Stanton took Bessie up in his
arms. "Bessie," he said, "did I vex you a
little last night?"</p>

<p>Bessie colored all over, but looking her
uncle steadily in the eyes, answered, "Yes,
sir; and I am sorry I felt so naughty."</p>

<p>"Nay," said Uncle Ruthven, smiling, "if I
teased you, although I did not intend it, I am
the one to beg pardon."</p>

<p>"But I was pretty mad, uncle, and I felt as
if I wanted to be naughty. I think I ought to
be sorry."</p>

<p>"As you please then, darling; we will
forgive one another. And now would you
like this little peace-offering from Uncle
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Ruthven?" and he took up the basket of
flowers.</p>

<p>"Is that for me?" asked Bessie, her eyes
sparkling.</p>

<p>"Yes. I thought perhaps I had hurt your
feelings last night, and so I brought it to you
that you might see <i>I</i> was sorry."</p>

<p>"But I could believe you without that."</p>

<p>Bessie felt reproached that she had told
Maggie she had "objections to Uncle Ruthven,"
and now she felt as if they had all
flown away.</p>

<p class="pmb3">"Perhaps you could," said Uncle Ruthven,
smiling as he kissed her; "but the flowers
are your own to do with as you please. And
now you must remember that I am not much
accustomed to little girls, and do not always
know what they like and what they do not
like; so you must take pity on the poor traveller,
if he makes a mistake now and then,
and believe he always wishes to please you
and make you love him as far as he knows
how."</p>

ncle Ruthven had brought home
with him two servants, the elder of
whom was a Swede, and did not interest
the children much, being, as Maggie said,
such a "very broken Englishman" that they
could scarcely understand him. But the
other was a little Persian boy about twelve
years old, whom a sad, or rather a happy accident,
had thrown into Mr. Stanton's hands.
Riding one day through the streets of a Persian
town, as he turned a corner, this boy ran
beneath his horse's feet, was thrown down and
badly hurt. Mr. Stanton took him up and
had him kindly cared for, and finding that the
boy was an orphan, with no one to love him,
he went often to see him, and soon became
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
much interested in the grateful, affectionate
little fellow; while Hafed learned to love
dearly the only face which looked kindly upon
him. When the time came for Mr. Stanton
to go away, Hafed's grief was terrible to see,
and he clung so to this new friend, that the
gentleman could not find it in his heart to
leave him. It was not difficult to persuade
those who had the care of him to give him
up; they were only too glad to be rid of the
charge. So, at some trouble to himself, Mr.
Stanton had brought him away. But if he
needed payment, he found it in Hafed's happy
face and tireless devotion to himself. He was
less of a servant than a pet; but his master
did not mean him to grow up in idleness and
ignorance, and as soon as he knew a little
English, he was to go to school to learn to
read and write; but at present he was allowed
time to become accustomed to his new
home.</p>

<p>The children thought him a great curiosity,
partly because of his foreign dress, and that
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
he had come from such a far-off country;
partly because he could speak only half a
dozen English words.</p>

<p>Hafed took a great fancy to the little girls,
and was never happier than when his master
took him to Mr. Bradford's house, and left
him to play with them for a while. Maggie
and Bessie liked him also, and they immediately
set about teaching him English. As yet,
he knew only four or five words, one of which
was "Missy," by which name he called every
one who wore skirts, not excepting Franky,
who considered it a great insult. Maggie was
very eager to have him learn new words, and
was constantly showing him something and
repeating the name over and over till he could
say it. But though he took great pains, and
was an apt scholar, he did not learn fast
enough to satisfy Maggie.</p>

<p>"Hafed," she said to him one day, holding
up her doll, "say 'doll.'"</p>

<p>"<i>Dole</i>," repeated Hafed, in his soft, musical
tones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>"Doll," said Maggie, not at all satisfied
with his pronunciation, and speaking in a
louder voice, as if Hafed could understand
the better for that.</p>

<p>"Dole," said Hafed again, with a contented
smile.</p>

<p>"D-o-o-ll," shrieked Maggie, in the ear of
her patient pupil, with no better success on
his part.</p>

<p>Miss Rush was sitting by, and she called
Maggie to her. "Maggie, dear," she said,
"you must not be impatient with Hafed. I
am sure he tries his best; but you must remember
it is hard work for that little foreign
tongue of his to twist itself to our English
words. He will learn to pronounce them in
time."</p>

<p>"But, Aunt Bessie," said Maggie, "mamma
said it was always best to learn to do a
thing well at first, and then one will not have
to break one's self of bad habits."</p>

<p>"And so it is, dear; but then we cannot
always do that at once. When mamma
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
teaches you French, you cannot always pronounce
the words as she does; can you?"</p>

<p>"No; ma'am; but those are hard French
words, and we are trying to teach Hafed English,
and that is so easy."</p>

<p>"Easy to you, dear, who are accustomed to
it, but not to him. It is even harder for him
to frame the English words than it is for you
to repeat the French; and you should be gentle
and patient with him, as mamma is with
you."</p>

<p>The little Persian felt the cold very much,
and delighted to hang about the fires and registers.
He had a way of going down on his
knees before the fire, and holding up both
hands with the palms towards the blaze. The
first time nurse saw him do this, she was
quite shocked.</p>

<p>"The poor little heathen," she said. "Well,
I've often heard of them fire-worshippers, but
I never expected to see one, at least, in this
house. I shall just make so bold as to tell
Mr. Ruthven he ought to teach him better."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>But Hafed was no fire-worshipper, for he
had been taught better, and thanks to his kind
master, did not bow down to that or any other
false god. It was only his delight in the roaring
blaze which had brought him down in
front of it, not, as nurse thought, the wish to
pray to it.</p>

<p>"Let's teach him about Jesus," said Bessie
to her sister. "First, we'll teach him to say
it, and then he'll want to know who he is."</p>

<p>So kneeling down beside the little stranger,
she took his hand in hers, and pointing upwards
said, "Jesus."</p>

<p>The boy's face lighted up immediately, and
to Bessie's great delight, he repeated Jesus in
a tone so clear and distinct as to show it was
no new word to him. He had a pretty way
when he wished to say he loved a person, of
touching his fingers to his lips, laying them
on his own heart, and then on that of the one
for whom he wished to express his affection.
Now, at the sound of the name, which he, as
well as Bessie, had learned to love, he tried, by
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
a change in the pretty sign, to express his
meaning. Touching first Bessie's lips and
then her heart with the tips of his fingers, he
softly blew upon them, as if he wished to waft
to heaven the love he could not utter in
words, saying, "Missy&mdash;Jesus?"</p>

<p>Bessie understood him. She knew he
wished to ask if she loved Jesus, and with a
sunny face, she answered him with a nod, asking,
in her turn, "Do you, Hafed,&mdash;do you
love Jesus?"</p>

<p>The boy went through the same sign with
his own heart and lips, saying, "Hafed&mdash;Jesus,"
and Bessie turned joyfully to her sister.</p>

<p>"He knows him, Maggie. We won't have
to teach him; he knows our Jesus, and he
loves him too. Oh, I'm so glad!"</p>

<p>"Now the Good Shepherd, that has called
ye to be his lambs, bless you both," said old
nurse, with the tears starting to her eyes.
"That's as cheering a sight as I want to see;
and there was me a misjudging of my boy. I
might have known him better than to think
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
he'd let one as belonged to him go on in darkness
and heathendom."</p>

<p>Nurse always called Mr. Stanton her "boy"
when she was particularly pleased with him.</p>

<p>From this time Hafed was almost as great a
favorite with nurse as he was with the children,
and seeing how gentle and thoughtful
he was, she would even sometimes leave them
for a few moments in his care.</p>

<p>One morning mamma and Aunt Bessie were
out, and Jane, who was sick, had gone to bed.
Hafed was in the nursery playing with the
children, when the chamber-maid came in to
ask nurse to go to Jane. Nurse hesitated at
first about leaving her charge, but they all
said they would be good, and Hafed should
take care of them. Nurse knew that this was
a safe promise from Maggie and Bessie, but
she feared that, with every intention of being
good, mischievous Franky would have himself
or the others in trouble if she stayed away
five minutes.</p>

<p>"See here," she said, "I'll put ye all into
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
the crib, and there ye may play omnibus till I
come back. That will keep ye out of harm's
way, Franky, my man, for if there's a chance
for you to get into mischief, ye'll find it."</p>

<p>This was a great treat, for playing in the
cribs and beds was not allowed without special
permission, and Franky, being provided with
a pair of reins, and a chair turned upside
down for a horse, took his post as driver, in
great glee; while the three little girls were
packed in as passengers, Maggie holding the
baby. Hafed was rather too large for the
crib, so he remained outside, though he, too,
enjoyed the fun, even if he did not quite understand
all it meant. Then, having with
many pointings and shakings of her head
made Hafed understand that he was not to go
near the fire or windows, or to let the children
fall out of the crib, mammy departed.</p>

<p>They were all playing and singing as happy
as birds, when the nursery-door opened, and
a stranger stood before them. In a moment
every voice was mute, and all five children
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
looked at her in utter astonishment. She was
an old lady, with hair as white as snow, tall
and handsome; but there was something
about her which made every one of the little
ones feel rather shy. They gazed at her in
silence while she looked from one to another
of them, and then about the room, as if those
grave, stern eyes were taking notice of the
smallest thing there.</p>

<p>"Well!" exclaimed the old lady, after a
moment's pause, "this is a pretty thing!"</p>

<p>By this time Bessie's politeness had gained
the better of her astonishment, and scrambling
to her feet, she stood upright in the
crib. As the stranger's eyes were fixed upon
Hafed as she spoke, the little girl supposed
the "pretty thing" meant the dress of
the young Persian, which the children
thought very elegant; and she answered,
"Yes, ma'am, but he is not to wear it
much longer, 'cause the boys yun after him
in the street, so Uncle Yuthven is having
some English clothes made for him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where is your mother?" asked the old
lady, without other notice of Bessie's speech.</p>

<p>"Gone out with Aunt Bessie, ma'am."</p>

<p>"And is there nobody left to take care of
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, ma'am," answered Bessie. "Maggie
and I are taking care of the children, and
Hafed is taking care of us."</p>

<p>"Humph!" said the old lady, as if she did
not think this at all a proper arrangement.
"I shall give Margaret a piece of my mind
about this."</p>

<p>Bessie now opened her eyes very wide.
"Papa don't allow it," she said, gravely.</p>

<p>"Don't allow what?" asked the stranger,
rather sharply.</p>

<p>"Don't allow mamma to be scolded."</p>

<p>"And who said I was going to scold her?"</p>

<p>"You said you were going to give her a
piece of your mind, and pieces of mind mean
scoldings, and we never have mamma scolded,
'cause she never deserves it."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the old lady, with a half-smile,
"then she is better than most people."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," answered Bessie, innocently,
"she is better than anybody, and
so is papa."</p>

<p>"Just as well <i>you</i> should think so," said
the lady, now smiling outright. "And you
are Maggie&mdash;no&mdash;Bessie, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am. I am Bessie, and this is
Maggie, and this is baby, and this is Franky,
and this is Hafed," said the child, pointing in
turn to each of her playmates.</p>

<p>"And is there no one but this little mountebank
to look after you?" asked the old lady.
"Where is your nurse?"</p>

<p>"She is coming back in a few minutes,"
answered Bessie. "And Hafed is not a&mdash;a&mdash;that
thing you called him, ma'am. He is only
a little Persian whom Uncle Yuthven brought
from far away over the sea, and he's a very
good boy. He does not know a great many
of our words, but he tries to learn them, and
he knows about our Jesus, and tries to be a
good little boy."</p>

<p>Dear Bessie wished to say all she could in
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
praise of Hafed, whom she thought the old
lady looked at with displeasure. Perhaps
Hafed thought so, also, for he seemed very
much as if he would like to hide away from
her gaze. Meanwhile Maggie sat perfectly
silent. When the old lady had first spoken,
she started violently, and, clasping her arms
tightly about the baby, looked more and more
frightened each instant; while baby, who was
not usually shy, nestled her little head timidly
against her sister's shoulder, and stared at the
stranger with eyes of grave infant wonder.</p>

<p>"And so you are Maggie," said the lady,
coming closer to the crib.</p>

<p>Poor Maggie gave a kind of gasp by way of
answer.</p>

<p>"Do you not know me, Maggie?" asked
the old lady, in a voice which she intended to
be coaxing.</p>

<p>To Bessie's dismay, Maggie burst into one
of those sudden and violent fits of crying, to
which she would sometimes give way when
much frightened or distressed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, why!" said the stranger, as the
baby, startled by Maggie's sobs, and the way
in which she clutched her, raised her voice
also in a loud cry. "Why, why! what is all
this about? Do you not know your Aunt
Patty?"</p>

<p>Aunt Patty! Was it possible? At this astounding
and alarming news, Bessie plumped
down again in the bed beside Maggie, amazed
at herself for having dared to speak so boldly
to that terrible person. And yet she had
not seemed so terrible, nor had she felt
much afraid of her till she found out who she
was.</p>

<p>But now Mrs. Lawrence was losing patience.
Certainly she had not had a very pleasant reception.
Coming cold and tired from a long
journey, she had found her host and hostess
out, and no one but the servants to receive
her. This was her own fault, of course, since
she had not told Mr. and Mrs. Bradford to expect
her; but that did not make it the less annoying
to her. It is not always the easier to
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
bear a thing because we ourselves are to blame
for it.</p>

<p>However, she had made up her mind not to
be vexed about it, and at once went to the
nursery to make acquaintance with the children.
But the greeting she received was not
of a kind to please any one, least of all a person
of Aunt Patty's temper. And there was
worse still to come.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of all this?" asked
Mrs. Lawrence, in an angry tone. "Here,
Maggie, give me that child, and stop crying
at once."</p>

<p>As she spoke, she tried to take the baby,
but poor Maggie, now in utter despair,
shrieked aloud for nurse, and held her little
sister closer than before. Aunt Patty was
determined, however, and much stronger than
Maggie, and in another minute the baby was
screaming in her arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, Maggie, why don't somebody come?"
cried Bessie. "Oh, do say those words to
her?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>Maggie had quite forgotten how she had intended
to alarm Aunt Patty if she interfered
with them; but when Bessie spoke, it came to
her mind, and the sight of her baby sister in
the old lady's arms was too much for her.
Springing upon her feet, she raised her arm
after the manner of the woman in the picture,
and gasped out, "Beware, woman!"</p>

<p>For a moment Aunt Patty took no notice
of her, being occupied with trying to soothe
the baby.</p>

<p>"Beware, woman!" cried Maggie, in a
louder tone, and stamping her foot.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lawrence turned and looked at her.</p>

<p class="pmb2">"Beware, woman!" shrieked Maggie, and
Bessie, thinking it time for her to come to her
sister's aid, joined in the cry, "Beware, woman!"
while Franky, always ready to take
part in any disturbance, struck at Aunt Patty
with his whip, and shouted, "'Ware, woman!"
and Hafed, knowing nothing but that
this old lady had alarmed and distressed his
young charge, and that it was his duty to protect
them, raised his voice in a whoop of defiance,
and snatching up the hearth-brush,
brandished it in a threatening manner as he
danced wildly about her. Nor was this all,
for Flossy, who had also been taken into the
crib as a passenger, commenced a furious
barking, adding greatly to the uproar.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 464px;">

<p class="pmb2" />


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>It would be difficult to say which was the
greatest, Aunt Patty's astonishment or her
anger; and there is no knowing what she
would have done or said, for at this moment
the door opened, and Uncle Ruthven appeared.</p>

<p>For a moment he stood perfectly motionless
with surprise. It was indeed a curious scene
upon which he looked. In the centre of the
room stood an old lady who was a stranger to
him, holding in her arms the screaming baby;
while around her danced his own little servant-boy,
looking as if he might be one of the wild
dervishes of his own country; and in the crib
stood his young nieces and Franky, all shouting,
"Beware, woman!" over and over again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>But Aunt Patty had not the least idea of
"running away, never to be seen again," and
if her conscience were "guilty," it certainly
did not seem to be at all alarmed by anything
Maggie or Bessie could do.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Mr. Stanton's appearance was
a great relief to her. Baby ceased her loud
cries, and stretched out her dimpled arms to
her uncle, with a beseeching whimper; Hafed
paused in his antics, and stood like a statue
at sight of his master; and the three other
children all turned to him with exclamations
of "Oh, Uncle Ruthven; we're so glad!" and
"Please don't leave us," from Maggie and
Bessie; and "Make dat Patty be off wiz herself,"
from Franky.</p>

<p>Mr. Stanton recovered himself in a moment,
and bowing politely to Mrs. Lawrence, said,
with a smile sparkling in his eye, "I fear
you are in some trouble, madam; can I help
you?"</p>

<p>"Help me?" repeated the old lady; "I
fear you will want help yourself. Why, it
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
must need half a dozen keepers to hold these
little Bedlamites in any kind of order."</p>

<p>"They are usually orderly enough," answered
Mr. Stanton as he took baby from
Aunt Patty, who was only too glad to give her
up; "but I do not understand this. What is
the matter, Maggie, and where is nurse?"</p>

<p>But Maggie only answered by a new burst
of sobs, and Bessie spoke for her. "She's
Aunt Patty, Uncle Yuthven; she says she is."</p>

<p>"Well," said Uncle Ruthven, more puzzled
than ever, for he knew little of Mrs. Lawrence,
save that she was Mr. Bradford's aunt, "and
do you welcome her with such an uproar as
this? Tell me where nurse is, Bessie."</p>

<p>As he spoke, nurse herself came in, answering
his question with, "Here I am, sir,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Nurse, in her turn, was so astonished by the
unexpected sight of Aunt Patty that she stood
quite still, gazing at her old enemy. But, as
she afterwards said, she presently "recollected
her manners," and dropping a stiff courtesy
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
to Mrs. Lawrence, she took the baby from Mr.
Stanton, and in a few words explained the
cause of her ten minutes' absence. The tearful
faces of her nurslings, and that of Aunt
Patty, flushed and angry, gave nurse a pretty
good guess how things had been going while
she had been away, but she saw fit to ask no
questions.</p>

<p>"My lady is out, ma'am," she said, with
a grim sort of politeness to Mrs. Lawrence,
"and I think she was not looking for you
just now, or she would have been at home."</p>

<p>Then Mr. Stanton introduced himself, and
asking Mrs. Lawrence if she would let him
play the part of host till his sister came home,
he offered the old lady his arm, and led her
away.</p>

<p>Poor Aunt Patty! she scarcely knew what
to do. The old angry, jealous temper and
the new spirit which had lately come to dwell
in her heart were doing hard battle, each
striving for the victory. She thought, and
not without reason, that her nephew's little
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
children must have been taught to fear and
dislike her, when they could receive her in
such a manner; and the evil spirit said, "Go,
do not remain in a house where you have
been treated so. Leave it, and never come
back to it. You have been insulted! do not
bear it! Tell these people what you think of
their unkindness, and never see them again."
But the better angel, the spirit of the meek
and lowly Master, of whom she was striving to
learn, said, "No, stay, and try to overcome
evil with good. This is all your own fault,
the consequence of your own ungoverned and
violent temper. Your very name has become
a name of fear to these innocent children;
but you must bear it, and let them find they
have no longer cause to dread you. And do
not be too proud to let their parents see that
you are sorry for the past, and wish it to be
forgotten. If this is hard, and not what you
would have expected, remember how much
they have borne from you in former days;
how patient and gentle and forbearing they
were."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, as her anger cooled down, she began
to think how very unlikely it was that Mr.
or Mrs. Bradford had said or done anything
which could cause their children to act in the
way Maggie and Bessie had done that morning.
This was probably the work of others
who remembered how perverse and trying she
had been during her last visit. And Aunt
Patty was forced to acknowledge to herself
that it was no more than she deserved, or
might have looked for.</p>

<p>And so, trying to reason herself into better
humor, as she thought the matter over, she
began to see its droll side (for Aunt Patty
had a quick sense of fun) and to find some
amusement mingling with her vexation at the
singular conduct of the children.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Stanton, who saw that the
poor lady had been greatly annoyed, and who
wondered much at all the commotion he had
seen in the nursery, though, like nurse, he
thought it wisest to ask no questions, was doing
his best to make her forget it; and so well
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
did he succeed, that presently Mrs. Lawrence
found herself, she scarcely knew how, laughing
heartily with him as she related the story
of Maggie's strange attack upon her. Mr.
Stanton understood it no better than she did,
perhaps not so well; but he was very much
amused; and as he thought these young
nieces and nephews of his were very wonderful
little beings, he told Aunt Patty many of
their droll sayings and doings, making himself
so agreeable and entertaining, that by the
time his sister came in, the old lady had almost
forgotten that she had cause to be offended,
and was not only quite ready to meet
Mrs. Bradford in a pleasant manner, but actually
went so far as to apologize for taking them
all by surprise.</p>

<p class="pmb3">This was a great deal to come from Aunt
Patty. She would not have spoken so four
years ago; but Mrs. Bradford was not more
surprised by this than she was at the difference
in look and manner which now showed
itself in the old lady. Surely, some great
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
change must have come to her; and her
friends, seeing how much more patient and
gentle she was than in former days, could not
but think it was the one blessed change which
must come to the hearts of those who seek for
love and peace by the true way.</p>

ut although such a great and delightful
alteration had taken place in Mrs.
Lawrence, and although Mrs. Bradford
and Miss Rush did all they could to
make the children feel kindly towards her, it
was some days before things went at all
smoothly between the old lady and the little
ones, and Annie Stanton, seeing the consequence
of her thoughtlessness, had more than
once reason to regret it, and to take to herself
a lesson to refrain from evil speaking.</p>

<p>Maggie and Bessie, it is true, were too old
and too well behaved to speak their fear and
their dislike openly, by word or action, but it
was plainly to be seen in their looks and
manners. Poor Aunt Patty! She heard the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
sweet, childish voices prattling about the
house, ringing out so freely and joyfully in
peals of merry laughter, or singing to simple
music the pretty hymns and songs their dear
mother and Mrs. Rush had taught them; but
the moment she appeared, sweet song, innocent
talk, and gay laugh were hushed; the
little ones were either silent, or whispered to
one another in subdued, timid tones. Little
feet would come pattering, or skipping along
the hall, a small, curly head peep within the
door, and then vanish at sight of her, while a
whisper of "She's there; let's run," told the
cause of its sudden disappearance. She saw
them clinging around their other friends and
relations with loving confidence, climbing upon
their knees, clasping their necks, pressing
sweet kisses on their cheeks and lips, asking
freely for all the interest, sympathy, and affection
they needed. Father and mother, grandparents,
aunts, and uncles, Colonel and Mrs.
Rush, the very servants, who had been long
in the house, all came in for a share of childish
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
love and trust. But for her they had
nothing but shy, downcast looks, timid, half-whispered
answers; they shrank from the
touch of her hand, ran from her presence.
Yes, poor Aunt Patty! the punishment was a
severe one, and, apart from the pain it gave
her, it was hard for a proud spirit such as hers
to bear. But she said nothing, did not even
complain to Mrs. Bradford of the reception
she had met with from Maggie and Bessie,
and it was only by Uncle Ruthven's account
and the confession of the little girls that their
mamma knew what had occurred.</p>

<p>On the morning after Mrs. Lawrence's arrival,
Maggie, as usual, brought the "Complete
Family" to her mother to have the spelling
corrected, and Mrs. Bradford found written,
"'Beware, woman!' is not a bit of use. It
don't frighten people a bit; not even gilty
conshuns, and Uncle John just teased me I
know. It is real mean."</p>

<p>Mamma asked the meaning of this, and, in
a very aggrieved manner, Maggie told her of
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
Uncle John's explanation of the picture, and
how she thought she would try the experiment
on Aunt Patty when she had insisted on taking
the baby.</p>

<p>"But it was all of no purpose, mamma,"
said Maggie, in a very injured tone; "she did
not care at all, but just stood there, looking
madder and madder."</p>

<p>Mamma could scarcely wonder that Aunt
Patty had looked "madder and madder," and
she told Maggie that she thought her aunt
wished to be kind and good since she had not
uttered one word of complaint at the rude reception
she had met with. But the little girl
did not see it with her mother's eyes, and
could not be persuaded to think less hardly of
Aunt Patty.</p>

<p>But that rogue, Franky, was not afraid to
show his feelings. He was a bold little monkey,
full of life and spirits, and always in mischief;
and now he seemed to have set himself
purposely to defy and brave Mrs. Lawrence,
acting as if he wished to see how far he could
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
go without meeting punishment at her hands.
This sad behavior of Franky's was particularly
unfortunate, because the old lady had
taken a special love for the little boy, fancying
he looked like the dear father who so many
years ago had been drowned beneath the blue
waters of the Swiss lake.</p>

<p>A day or two after Aunt Patty came, she,
with Mrs. Bradford and Miss Rush, was in
the parlor with three or four morning visitors.
Franky had just learned to open the nursery
door for himself, and this piece of knowledge
he made the most of, watching his chance
and slipping out the moment nurse's eye was
turned from him. Finding one of these opportunities
for which he was so eager, he ran
out and went softly down-stairs, fearing to
hear nurse calling him back. But nurse did
not miss him at first, and he reached the parlor
in triumph. Here the door stood partly
open, and putting in his head, he looked
around the room. No one noticed the roguish
little face, with its mischievous, dancing eyes,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
for all the ladies were listening to Aunt Patty,
as she told them some very interesting anecdote.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came from the door, in
clear, childish tones, "Ladies, ladies, does
Patty stold oo? Oo better wun away, she
stolds very dreadful."</p>

<p>After which Master Franky ran away himself
as fast as his feet could carry him, laughing
and chuckling as he mounted the stairs,
as if he had done something very fine.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lawrence went straight on with her
story, not pausing for an instant, though that
she heard quite as plainly as any one else was
to be seen by the flush of color on her cheek,
and the uplifting of the already upright head.</p>

<p>As for poor Mrs. Bradford, it was very mortifying
for her; but what was to be done?
Nothing, just nothing, as far as Aunt Patty
was concerned. It was not a thing for which
pardon could well be asked or an apology
made, and Mrs. Bradford thought the best
way was to pass it over in silence. She
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
talked very seriously to Franky, but it seemed
impossible to make the little boy understand
that he had done wrong; and, although nothing
quite as bad as this occurred again for several
days, he still seemed determined to make
war upon Aunt Patty whenever he could find
a chance of doing so. And yet, strange to
say, this unruly young gentleman was the
first one of the children to make friends with
his old auntie; and it came about in this
way:&mdash;</p>

<p>Aunt Bessie had brought as her Christmas
gift to Franky a tiny pair of embroidered
slippers, which were, as her namesake said,
"perferly cunning," and in which the little boy
took great pride. Nurse, also, thought a great
deal of these slippers, and was very choice of
them, allowing Franky to wear them only
while she was dressing or undressing him.
But one day when she brought him in from
his walk, she found his feet very cold, and taking
off his walking-shoes, she put on the slippers,
and planted him in front of the fire, telling
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
him to "toast his toes." No sooner did
the little toes begin to feel at all comfortable
than Franky looked around for some way
of putting them to what he considered their
proper use; namely, trotting about. That
tempting nursery-door stood ajar, nurse's eyes
were turned another way, and in half a minute
he was off again. Mammy missed him
very soon, and sent Jane to look for him.
She met him coming up-stairs, and brought
him back to the nursery with a look in his eye
which nurse knew meant that he had been
in mischief. And was it possible? He was
in his stocking feet! The precious slippers
were missing. In vain did the old woman
question him; he would give her no answer,
only looking at her with roguishness dancing
in every dimple on his chubby face; and in
vain did Jane search the halls and staircase.
So at last nurse took him to his mother, and
very unwilling he was to go, knowing right
well that he had been naughty, and that now
he would be obliged to confess it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where are your slippers, Franky?" asked
Mrs. Bradford, when nurse had told her
story.</p>

<p>Franky hung his head and put his finger
into his mouth, then lifted his face coaxingly
to his mother for a kiss.</p>

<p>"Mamma cannot kiss you till you are a
good boy," said Mrs. Bradford, and repeated
her question, "Where are your slippers?"</p>

<p>"In Patty's pottet," said Franky, seeing
that his mother would have an answer, and
thinking he had best have it out.</p>

<p>"And how came they in Aunt Patty's
pocket?"</p>

<p>"She put dem dere hersef," answered the
child.</p>

<p>"Did she take them off your feet, Franky?"</p>

<p>"No, mamma," answered Franky, liking
these questions still less than he had done the
others.</p>

<p>"How did they come off then?"</p>

<p>"Me trow dem at Patty," said Franky.</p>

<p>At last, after much more questioning and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
some whimpering from the child, he was
brought to confess that he had gone to the
library, where he found Aunt Patty. Defying
her as usual, and trying how far he could go,
without punishment, he had called her "bad
old sing," and many other naughty names;
but finding this did not bring the expected
scolding, he had pulled off first one and then
the other of his slippers and thrown them
at the old lady. These Mrs. Lawrence had
picked up and put in her pocket, still without
speaking. Little Franky could not tell how
sorrow and anger were both struggling in her
heart beneath that grave silence.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Bradford had found out all
Franky could or would tell, she told him
he was a very naughty little boy, and since he
had behaved so badly to Aunt Patty, he must
go at once and ask her pardon. This Franky
had no mind to do. He liked very well to
brave Aunt Patty from a safe distance; but
he did not care to trust himself within reach
of the punishment he knew he so justly deserved.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
Besides, he was in a naughty, obstinate
mood, and would not obey his mother as
readily as usual. But mamma was determined,
as it was right she should be, and after
rather a hard battle with her little son,
she carried him down-stairs, still sobbing, but
subdued and penitent, to beg Aunt Patty's
forgiveness.</p>

<p>"Me sorry, me do so any more," said
Franky, meaning he would do so no more.</p>

<p>To his surprise, and also somewhat to his
mother's, the old lady caught him in her
arms, and covered his face with kisses, while
a tear or two shone in her eye.</p>

<p>"Don't ky; me dood now," lisped Franky,
forgetting all his fear, and putting up his
hand to wipe away her tears; and from this
minute Aunt Patty and Franky were the
best of friends. Indeed, so indulgent did she
become to him, that papa and mamma were
quite afraid he would be spoiled; for the little
gentleman, finding out his power, lorded it
over her pretty well. Mrs. Bradford, coming
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
in unexpectedly one day, actually found the
old lady on her hands and knees, in a corner,
playing the part of a horse eating hay from a
manger; while Franky, clothes-brush in hand,
was, much to his own satisfaction, pretending
to rub her down, making the hissing noise
used by coachmen when they curry a horse,
and positively refusing to allow his patient
playfellow to rise.</p>

<p>But Maggie and Bessie could not be persuaded
to be at all friendly or sociable with Aunt
Patty. True, after their first dread of her
wore off, and they found she was by no means
so terrible as they had imagined, they no longer
scampered off at the least sound of her
voice or glimpse of her skirts, as they had
done at first; and Bessie even found courage
to speak to her now and then, always looking
however, as if she thought she was running a
great risk, and could not tell what would be
the consequence of such boldness. For after
all they had heard, our little girls found
it impossible to believe that such a great
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
change had taken place in Aunt Patty, and
were always watching for some outbreak of
temper.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Unhappily there was one thing which stood
much in Aunt Patty's way, not only with the
children, but perhaps with some grown people
also, and that was her old way of meddling
and finding fault with things which did
not concern her. This she did, almost without
knowing it; for so it is, where we have
long indulged in a habit, it becomes, as it
were, a part of ourselves, and the older we
grow, the harder it is to rid ourselves of it.
And there are few things which sooner rouse
the evil passions and dislike of others than this
trick of fault-finding where we have no right
or need to do so, or of meddling with that
which does not concern us. So Mrs. Lawrence,
without intending it, was constantly
fretting and aggravating those around her
while Maggie and Bessie, who thought that all
their mamma did or said was quite perfect,
were amazed and indignant when they heard
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
her rules and wishes questioned and found
fault with, and sometimes even set aside by
Aunt Patty, if she thought another way better.</p>

</span>
ne Sunday when Mrs. Lawrence had
been with them about two weeks, Maggie
and Bessie, on going as usual to
their class at Mrs. Rush's, found that they two
were to make up her whole class that morning;
for Gracie Howard was sick, and Lily
Norris gone on a visit to her grandfather who
lived in the country. Mrs. Rush was not very
sorry to have her favorite scholars by themselves,
for she wished to give them a little lesson
which it was not necessary that the others
should hear. And Maggie gave her the opportunity
for which she wished by asking Colonel
Rush for the story of Benito.</p>

<p>"For," said the little girl, "if we were
away and Lily and Gracie here, and you told
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
them a new story, we should be very disappointed
not to hear it; so Bessie and I made
agreement to ask for an old one, and we like
Benito better than any."</p>

<p>"Very well; it shall be as you say," replied
the colonel, who, provided his pets were
satisfied, was so himself, and after the children
had gone, he said to his wife, "Certainly
there are few things in which our sweet little
Maggie does not act up to the Golden Rule, of
which she is so fond. She does not repeat it
in a parrot-like way, as many do, but she understands
what it means, and practises it too,
with her whole heart."</p>

<p>So when the lessons were over, the colonel
told the story of Benito, which never seemed
to lose its freshness with these little listeners.
When he came to the part where Benito
helped the old dame with her burden, Mrs.
Rush said, "Children, what do you think that
burden was?"</p>

<p>"We don't know," said Bessie. "What?"</p>

<p>"Neither do I <i>know</i>," answered Mrs. Rush.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
"I was only thinking what it <i>might</i> be. Perhaps
it was pain and sickness; perhaps the
loss of friends; perhaps some old, troublesome
sin, sorely repented of, long struggled with,
but which still returned again and again, to
weary and almost discourage her as she toiled
along in the road which led to the Father's
house. Perhaps it was all of them; but what
ever it was, Benito did not pause to ask; he
only thought of his Lord's command, 'Bear
ye one another's burdens;' and so put his
hand to the load, and eased the old dame's
pain and weariness. Was it not so?" she
asked of her husband.</p>

<p>"I think so," he answered.</p>

<p>"But a little child could not help grown
persons to bear their sins, or to cure them,"
said Bessie; "they must go to Jesus for
that."</p>

<p>"Yes, we must go to Jesus; but the very
love and help and pity we have from him
teach us to show all we can to our fellow-creatures,
whether they are young or old.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
One of the good men whom Jesus left on
earth to do his work and preach his word
tells us that Christ was 'touched with the
feeling of our infirmities, because he was in
all points tempted like as we are.' This
means that, good and pure and holy as he
was, yet he allowed himself to suffer all the
trials and struggles and temptations which can
come to poor, weak man, so that he might
know just what we feel as we pass through
them, and just what help we need. Yet,
sorely tempted as he was, he never fell into
sin, but returned to his Father's heaven pure
and stainless as he left it. Since then Christ
feels for all the pains and struggles through
which we go for his sake, since he can make
allowance for all our weakness and failures;
and as he is so ready to give us help in our
temptations, so much the more ought we
who are not only tempted, but too apt, in
spite of our best efforts, to fall into sin, to
show to others all the kindness and sympathy
we may at any time need for ourselves. So
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
may we try to copy our Saviour, 'bearing one
another's burdens,' even as he has borne ours,
by giving love and pity and sympathy where
we can give nothing else. Benito was a very
young child, scarcely able to walk on the narrow
road without the help of some older and
wiser hand, and his weak shoulders could
not carry any part of the old dame's load;
but he put his baby hands beneath it, and
gave her loving smiles and gentle words, and
these brought her help and comfort, so that
she went on her way, strengthened for the
rest of the journey. And, as we know, Benito
met his reward as he came to the gates of his
Father's house. So much may the youngest
do for the oldest; and I think <i>we</i> know of an
old dame whose 'burden' our little pilgrims,
Maggie and Bessie, might help to bear, if they
would."</p>

<p>"I just believe you mean Aunt Patty!"
exclaimed Bessie, in such a tone as showed
she was not very well pleased with the idea.</p>

<p>"And," said Maggie, with just the least little
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
pout, "I don't believe she is a dame pilgrim,
and I don't believe she is in the narrow
path, not a bit!"</p>

<p>"There I think you are mistaken, Maggie,
for, so far as we can judge, there is reason to
think Aunt Patty is walking in the safe and
narrow road which leads to the Father's
house; and, since she has not been brought
to it by paths quite so easy and pleasant as
some of us have known, there is all the more
reason that we happier travellers should give
her a helping hand. It may be very little that
we can give; a word, a look, a smile, a kind
offer to go for some little trifle that is needed,
will often cheer and gladden a heart that is
heavy with its secret burden. And if we now
and then get a knock, or even a rather hard
scratch from those corners of our neighbor's
load, which are made up of little faults and
odd tempers, we must try not to mind it, but
think only of how tired those poor, weary
shoulders must be of the weight they carry."</p>

<p>"But, Mrs. Rush," said Maggie, "Aunt
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
Patty's corners scratch very hard, and hurt
very much."</p>

<p>"But the corners are not half as sharp as
they were once; are they, dear?" asked Mrs.
Rush, smiling.</p>

<p>"Well," said Maggie, slowly, as if she
were considering, "maybe her temper corner
is not so sharp as it used to be, but her
meddling corner is very bad,&mdash;yes, very bad
indeed; and it scratches like everything.
Why, you don't know how she meddles,
and what things she says, even when she is
not a bit mad. She is all the time telling
mamma how she had better manage; just as
if mamma did not know a great deal better
than she does about her own children and
her own house, and about everything! And
she dismanages Franky herself very much;
and she said dear Aunt Bessie deserved to
have such a bad sore throat 'cause she would
go out riding with Uncle Ruthven, when she
told her it was too cold; and she said the
colonel"&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>"There, there, that will do," said Mrs.
Rush, gently. "Do not let us think of what
Aunt Patty does to vex us, but see if we do
not sometimes grieve her a little."</p>

<p>"Oh! she don't think you do anything,"
said Maggie; "she says you are a very lovely
young woman."</p>

<p>"Well," said the colonel, laughing, "neither
you nor I shall quarrel with her for that;
shall we? There is one good mark for Aunt
Patty; let us see how many more we can
find."</p>

<p>"She was very good to Patrick when he
hurt his hand so the other day," said Bessie.
"She washed it, and put a yag on it, and
made it feel a great deal better."</p>

<p>"And she likes Uncle Ruthven very much,"
said Maggie.</p>

<p>"That is right," said Mrs. Rush, "think
of all the good you can. When we think
kindly of a person, we soon begin to act
kindly towards them, and I am quite sure
that a little love and kindness from you
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
would do much to lighten Aunt Patty's
burden. And if the sharp corners fret and
worry you a little, remember that perhaps
it is only the weight of the rest of the burden
which presses these into sight, and then
you will not feel them half as much. Will
you try if you can be like Benito, and so receive
the blessing of Him who says the cup
of cold water given in his name shall meet its
reward?"</p>

<p>"We'll try," said Maggie, "but I don't
think we'll succeed."</p>

<p>"And if at first you don't succeed, what
then?"</p>

<p>"Then try, try, try again," said Maggie,
cheerfully, for she was already trying to think
what she might do to make Aunt Patty's burden
more easy; "but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what, dear?"</p>

<p>"I hope she won't shed tears of joy upon
my bosom," said Maggie, growing grave again
at the thought of such a possibility; "I
wouldn't quite like <i>that</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what does Bessie say?" asked the
colonel.</p>

<p>"I was thinking how precious it is," said
the little girl, turning upon the colonel's face
those serious brown eyes which had been gazing
so thoughtfully into the fire.</p>

<p>"How precious what is, my darling?"</p>

<p>"To think Jesus knows how our temptations
feel, 'cause he felt them himself, and so
knows just how to help us and be sorry for
us."</p>

<p>Colonel Rush had his answer to both questions.</p>

<p>That same Sunday evening, the children
were all with their father and mother in the
library. Mrs. Lawrence sat in an arm-chair
by the parlor fire, alone, or nearly so, for Miss
Rush and Mr. Stanton in the window at the
farther side of the room were not much company
to any one but themselves.</p>

<p>Certainly the poor old lady felt lonely
enough, as, with her clasped hands lying
upon her lap, her chin sunk upon her breast,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
and her eyes fixed upon the fire, she thought
of the long, long ago, when she, too, was
young, bright, and happy; when those around
lived only for her happiness.</p>

<p>Ah! how different it all was now! They
were all gone,&mdash;the youth, the love, the happiness;
gone, also, were the wasted years which
she might have spent in the service of the Master
whom she had sought so late; gone all the
opportunities which he had given her of gaining
the love and friendship of her fellow-creatures.
And now how little she could do, old
and feeble and helpless as she was. And
what hard work it was to struggle with the
evil tempers and passions to which she had so
long given way; how difficult, when some trifle
vexed her, to keep back the sharp and
angry word, to put down the wish to bend
everything to her own will, to learn of Him
who was meek and lowly in heart!</p>

<p>And there was no one to know, no one to
sympathize, no one to give her a helping hand
in this weary, up-hill work, to guess how heavily
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
the burden of past and present sin bore
upon the poor, aching shoulders. In her
longing for the human love and sympathy she
had once cast from her, and which she could
not now bring herself to ask, the poor old lady
almost forgot that there was one Eye to see
the struggles made for Jesus' sake, one Hand
outstretched to save and to help, one Voice to
whisper, "Be of good courage."</p>

<p>True, Mr. and Mrs. Bradford were always
kind and thoughtful, and all treated her with
due respect and consideration; but that was
not all she wanted. If the children would
but love and trust her. There would be such
comfort in that; but in spite of all her efforts,
they were still shy and shrinking,&mdash;all, save
that little tyrant, Franky. Even fearless Fred
was quiet and almost dumb in her presence.</p>

<p>So Aunt Patty sat, and sadly thought, unconscious
of the wistful pair of eyes which
watched her from the other room, until by
and by a gentle footstep came stealing round
her chair, a soft little hand timidly slipped itself
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
into her own, and she turned to see Bessie's
sweet face looking at her, half in pity,
half in wonder.</p>

<p>"Well, dear," she asked, after a moment's
surprised silence, "What is it?"</p>

<p>Truly, Bessie scarcely knew herself what it
was. She had been watching Aunt Patty as
she sat looking so sad and lonely, and thinking
of Mrs. Rush's lesson of the morning, till
her tender little heart could bear it no longer,
and she had come to the old lady's side, not
thinking of anything particular she would do
or say, but just with the wish to put a loving
hand to the burden.</p>

<p>"Do you want anything, Bessie?" asked
Mrs. Lawrence again.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, but"&mdash;Bessie did not quite
like to speak of Aunt Patty's troubles, so
she said, "<i>I</i> have a little burden, too, Aunt
Patty."</p>

<p>Aunt Patty half smiled to herself as she
looked into the earnest, wistful eyes. She,
this innocent little one, the darling and pet
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
of all around her, what burden could she
have to bear? She did not know the meaning
of the word. Then came a vexed, suspicious
thought.</p>

<p>"Who told you that I had any burden to
bear, child?" she asked, sharply.</p>

<p>"Every one has; haven't they?" said Bessie,
rather frightened; then, strong in her loving,
holy purpose, she went on. "Everybody
has some burden; don't they, Aunt Patty? If
our Father makes them very happy, still they
have their faults, like I do. And if he don't
make them very happy, the faults are a great
deal harder to bear; are they not?"</p>

<p>"And what burden have you, dearie?"
asked the old lady, quite softened.</p>

<p>"My tempers," said the child, gravely. "I
used to be in passions very often, Aunt Patty,
till Jesus helped me so much, and very often
now I have passions in myself when some one
makes me offended; but if I ask Him quite
quick to help me, he always does. But it is
pretty hard sometimes, and I think that is my
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
burden. Maybe it's only a little one, though,
and I oughtn't to speak about it."</p>

<p>Aunt Patty was surprised, no less at the
child's innocent freedom in speaking to her
than at what she said, for she had never suspected
that gentle little Bessie had a passionate
temper. She looked at her for a moment,
and then said, "Then thank God every day of
your life, Bessie, that he has saved you from
the misery of growing up with a self-willed,
ungoverned temper. Thank him that his
grace has been sufficient to help you to battle
with it while you are young, that age and long
habit have not strengthened it till it seems
like a giant you cannot overcome. You will
never know what misery it becomes then,
with what force the tempter comes again and
again; <i>no one</i> knows, <i>no one</i> knows!"</p>

<p>Perhaps Mrs. Lawrence was talking more to
herself than to Bessie; but the child understood her,
and answered her.</p>

<p>"Jesus knows," she said, softly, and with that
tender, lingering tone with which she
always spoke the Saviour's name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>"Jesus knows," repeated the old lady, almost
as if the thought came to her for the
first time.</p>

<p>"Yes, Jesus knows," said Bessie, putting
up her small fingers with a little caressing
touch to Aunt Patty's cheek; "and is it not
sweet and precious, Aunt Patty, to think he
had temptations too, and so can know just
how hard we have to try not to grieve him?
Mrs. Rush told us about it to-day, and I love
to think about it all the time. And she told
us how he helped every one to bear their burdens;
and now we ought to help each other
too, 'cause that was what he wanted us to do.
But if sometimes we cannot help each other,
'cause we don't know about their burdens,
Jesus can always help us, 'cause he always
knows; don't he?"</p>

<p>"Bessie, come and sing," called mamma
from the other room, and away ran the little
comforter to join her voice with the others in
the Sabbath evening hymn.</p>

<p>Yes, she had brought comfort to the worn
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
and weary heart; she had put her hand to
Aunt Patty's burden and eased the aching
pain.</p>

<p>"Jesus knows." Again and again the
words came back to her, bringing peace and
rest and strength for all days to come. She
had heard it often before; she knew it well.
"Jesus knows;" but the precious words had
never come home to her before as they did
when they were spoken by the sweet, trustful,
childish voice,&mdash;"Jesus knows."</p>

<p>There is no need to tell that they were
friendly after this, these two pilgrims on the
heavenward way,&mdash;the old woman and the little
child, she who had begun to tread in her
Master's footsteps so early in life's bright
morning, and she who had not sought to follow
him until the eleventh hour, when her
day was almost ended. For they were both
clinging to one faith, both looking to one
hope, and the hand of the younger had drawn
the feet of the elder to a firmer and surer foothold
upon the Rock of Ages, on which both
were resting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>And how was it with our Maggie?</p>

<p>It was far harder work for her to be sociable
with Aunt Patty than it was for Bessie; for
besides her fear of the old lady, there was her
natural shyness to be struggled with. As for
speaking to her, unless it was to give a timid
"yes" or "no" when spoken to, that was, at
first, by no means possible; but remembering
that Mrs. Rush had said that a look or a
smile might show good-will or kindness, she
took to looking and smiling with all her
might. She would plant herself at a short
distance from Aunt Patty, and stare at the
old lady till she looked up and noticed her,
when she would put on the broadest of smiles,
and immediately run away, frightened at her
own boldness.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lawrence was at first displeased,
thinking Maggie meant this for impertinence
or mockery; but Mrs. Bradford, having
once or twice caught Maggie at this
extraordinary performance, asked what it
meant, and was told by her little daughter
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
that she was only "trying to bear Aunt Patty's
burden."</p>

<p>Then followed an account of what Mrs.
Rush had taught the children on Sunday.</p>

<p>"But, indeed, indeed, mamma," said poor
Maggie, piteously, "I don't think I can do
any better. I do feel so frightened when she
looks at me, and she don't look as if she liked
me to smile at her, and this morning she said,
'What are you about, child?' <i>so</i> crossly!"</p>

<p>Mamma praised and encouraged her, and
afterwards explained to Aunt Patty that Maggie
only meant to be friendly, but that her
bashfulness and her friendliness were sadly in
each other's way. So Mrs. Lawrence was no
longer displeased, but like the rest of Maggie's
friends, rather amused, when she saw her desperate
efforts to be sociable; and after a time
even Maggie's shyness wore away. Before
this came about, however, she and Bessie had
made a discovery or two which amazed them
very much.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Surely, it might be said of each of these little
ones, "She hath done what she could."</p>

ome time after this Aunt Patty bought
a magnificent toy menagerie, not for
a present to any of her young nieces
and nephews, but to keep as an attraction to
her own room when she wished for their company.</p>

<p>Even Maggie could not hold out against
such delightful toys, and after some coaxing
from Bessie, and a good deal of peeping
through the crack of the door at these wonderful
animals, she ventured into Aunt Patty's
room.</p>

<p>The two little girls, with Franky, were there
one morning while mamma and Aunt Patty
sat at their work. The animals had been put
through a great number of performances, after
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
which it was found necessary to put the menagerie
in thorough order. For this purpose
the wild beasts were all taken from their
cages, and tied with chains of mamma's
bright-colored worsteds to the legs of the
chairs and tables, while the cages were
rubbed and dusted; after which they were
to be escorted home again. This proved a
very troublesome business, for the animals,
as was quite natural, preferred the fields,
which were represented by the green spots in
the carpet, to the cages, where they were so
closely shut up, and did not wish to be carried
back. At least, so Maggie said when mamma
asked the cause of all the growling and roaring
which was going on.</p>

<p>"You see, mamma," she said, "they want
to run away to their own forests, and they
tried to devour their keepers, till some very
kind giants, that's Bessie and Franky and
me, came to help the keepers."</p>

<p>But now Flossy, who had been lying quietly
on the rug, watching his chance for a bit of
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
mischief, thought he had better help the giants,
and rushing at an elephant with which
Franky was having a great deal of trouble,
tossed it over with his nose, and sent it whirling
against the side of the room, where it lay
with a broken leg and trunk. Alas, for the
poor elephant! It was the first one of the
toys that had been broken, and great was the
mourning over its sad condition, while Flossy
was sent into the corner in disgrace. Of
course, it was not possible for the elephant
to walk home; he must ride.</p>

<p>"Patty," said Franky, "do down-'tairs and
det my water-tart; it's in de lib'ry."</p>

<p>"Franky, Franky!" said mamma, "is that
the way to speak to Aunt Patty?"</p>

<p>"Please," Said Franky.</p>

<p>"Aunt Patty has a bone in her foot," said
Mrs. Lawrence.</p>

<p>Franky put his head on one side, and looking
quizzically at the old lady, said, "Oo went
down-'tairs for oo bastet wis a bone in oo foot,
so oo tan do for my tart wis a bone in oo foot."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>Maggie and Bessie knew that this was
saucy, and expected that Aunt Patty would
be angry; but, to their surprise, she laughed,
and would even have gone for the cart if
mamma had not begged her not to.</p>

<p>"Franky," said mamma, as the little girls,
seeing Aunt Patty was not displeased, began
to chuckle over their brother's cute speech,
"you must not ask Aunt Patty to run about
for you. It is not pretty for little boys to do
so."</p>

<p>"But me want my tart to wide dis poor efelant,"
said Franky, coaxingly.</p>

<p>Bessie said she would go for the cart, and
ran away down-stairs. She went through the
parlor, and reaching the library-door, which
stood ajar, pushed it open. Aunt Bessie and
Uncle Ruthven were there; and what did she
see? Was it possible?</p>

<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>At this the two culprits turned, and seeing
Bessie's shocked and astonished face, Uncle
Ruthven laughed outright, his own hearty,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
ringing laugh. "Come here, princess," he
said.</p>

<p>But Bessie was off, the cart quite forgotten.
Through the hall and up the stairs, as fast as
the little feet could patter, never pausing till
she reached mamma's room, where she buried
her face in one of the sofa cushions; and there
her mother found her some moments later.</p>

<p>"Why, Bessie, my darling, what is it?"
asked mamma. "What has happened to
you?"</p>

<p>Bessie raised her flushed and troubled face,
but she was not crying, as her mother had
supposed, though she looked quite ready to
do so.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma!" she said, as Mrs. Bradford
sat down and lifted her up on her lap.</p>

<p>"What has troubled you, dearest?"</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, such a shocking thing! I
don't know how to tell you."</p>

<p>"Have you been in any mischief, dear? If
you have, do not be afraid to tell your own
mamma."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! it was not me, mamma, but it was a
dreadful, dreadful mischief."</p>

<p>"Well, darling, if any of the others have
been in mischief, of which I should know, I
do not think you will speak of it unless it is
necessary!"</p>

<p>"But you ought to know it, mamma, so
you can see about it; it was so very unproper.
But it was not any of us children; it was big
people&mdash;it was&mdash;it was&mdash;Uncle Yuthven
and Aunt Bessie; and I'm afraid they won't
tell you themselves."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Bradford, trying to keep
a grave face, as she imagined she began to see
into the cause of the trouble. She need not
have tried to hide her smiles. Her little
daughter buried her face on her bosom, as she
whispered the, to her, shocking secret, and
never once looked up at her mother.</p>

<p>"Mamma,&mdash;he&mdash;he&mdash;<i>kissed</i> her!&mdash;he
did&mdash;and she never scolded him, not a
bit."</p>

<p>Still the disturbed little face was hidden,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
and mamma waited a moment till she could
compose her own, and steady her voice.</p>

<p>"My darling," she said, "I have a pleasant
secret to tell you. You love dear Aunt Bessie
very much; do you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma, dearly, dearly; and, mamma,
she's very much mine,&mdash;is she not?&mdash;'cause
I'm her namesake; and Uncle Yuthven
ought not to do it. He had no yight. Mamma,
don't you think papa had better ask him to go
back to Africa for a little while?"</p>

<p>Bessie's voice was rather angry now.
Mamma had once or twice lately seen
signs of a little jealous feeling toward Uncle
Ruthven. She, Bessie the younger,
thought it very strange that Bessie the
elder should go out walking or driving
so often with Uncle Ruthven, or that they
should have so many long talks together.
Uncle Ruthven took up quite too much of
Aunt Bessie's time, according to little Bessie's
thinking. She had borne it pretty well,
however, until now; but that Uncle Ruthven
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
should "make so intimate" as to kiss Aunt
Bessie, was the last drop in the cup, and she
was displeased as well as distressed.</p>

<p>"And if papa had the power," said Mrs.
Bradford, "would my Bessie wish Uncle
Ruthven sent away again, and so grieve dear
grandmamma, who is so glad to have him at
home once more, to say nothing of his other
friends? I hope my dear little daughter is
not giving way to that ugly, hateful feeling,
jealousy."</p>

<p>"Oh! I hope not, mamma," said Bessie. "I
would not like to be so naughty. And if you
think it's being jealous not to like Uncle Yuthven
to&mdash;to do that, I'll try not to mind it so
much;" and here a great sob escaped her,
and a tear or two dropped on mamma's hand.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bradford thought it best to make
haste and tell her the secret.</p>

<p>"My darling," she said, "you know, though
you are so fond of dear Aunt Bessie, she is not
related to you,&mdash;not really your aunt."</p>

<p>"Yes'm, but then I love her just as much
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
as if she was my very, very own. I have to
love her for so many yeasons; 'cause she is
her own self and I can't help it, and 'cause
I'm her namesake, and 'cause she's my dear
soldier's own sister. Mamma, don't you think
that is plenty of yeasons to be fond of her
for?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, but you must be willing to
have others fond of her too. And do you not
think it would be very pleasant to have her for
your own aunt, and to keep her always with
us for our very own?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, mamma! but then that could
not be; could it?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes," said Mrs. Bradford; "if Uncle
Ruthven marries her, she will really be
your aunt, and then she will live at grandmamma's,
where you may see her almost
every day, and feel she is quite one of the
family."</p>

<p>"And is he going to, mamma?" asked
Bessie, raising her head, and with the utmost
surprise and pleasure breaking over her face;
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
"is Uncle Yuthven going to marry her, and
make her our true aunt?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe so," answered her mother;
"it was all settled a few days ago. We did
not mean to tell you just yet, but now I
thought it better. But, Bessie, if you send
poor Uncle Ruthven away to Africa again,
I fear you will lose Aunt Bessie too, for she
will go with him."</p>

<p>"I was naughty to say that, dear mamma,"
said Bessie, her whole face in a glow of delight,
"and I am so sorry I felt cross to Uncle Yuthven
just when he was doing us such a great,
great favor. Oh, he was so very kind to
think of it! He has been trying to give us
pleasure ever since he came home, and now he
has done the very best thing of all. He knew
just what we would like; did he not, mamma?"</p>

<p>Mamma laughed. "I rather think he knew
we would all be pleased, Bessie."</p>

<p>"I must thank him very much indeed,&mdash;must
I not, mamma?&mdash;and tell him how very
obliging I think he is."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>"You may thank him just as much as you
please, dear," said mamma, merrily. "Here
comes Maggie to see what has become of us.
She must hear this delightful secret too."</p>

<p>So Maggie was told, and went capering
round the room in frantic delight at the news,
inventing, as usual, so many plans and pleasures
that might fit in with this new arrangement,
that Bessie was better satisfied than ever,
and even forgave Uncle Ruthven the kiss.</p>

<p>And here was a second joy at hand; for in
came a message from Mrs. Rush, asking that
the little girls might come over to the hotel
and spend the rest of the day with her and
the colonel. They were always ready enough
for this, and in a short time they were dressed
and on their way with Starr, the colonel's
man, who had come for them.</p>

<p>Starr was a soldier, straight, stiff, and very
grave and respectful in his manner; and now,
as he walked along, leading a little girl in each
hand, they wondered to see how very smiling
he looked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>"Starr," said Bessie, peeping up in his face,
"have you some good news?"</p>

<p>"I've no bad news, miss," said Starr, with
a broader smile than before.</p>

<p>"You look so very pleased," said Bessie;
to which Starr only replied, "It's likely,
miss," and became silent again.</p>

<p>When they reached the long crossing, who
should be standing on the corner but Sergeant
Richards. Bessie saw him at once, and went
directly up to him.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mr. Station Policeman?"
she said, politely, and holding out her morsel
of a hand to him. "This is my Maggie."</p>

<p>"Well, now, but I'm glad to see you, and
your Maggie too," said the police-sergeant.
"And how have you been this long time?"</p>

<p>"Pretty well," answered Bessie. "How
are your blind boy and your lame wife and
your sick baby, and all your troubles?"</p>

<p>"Why, the wife is able to move round a
little," said Richards, "and the baby is mending
a bit too."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>"And Willie?" asked Bessie.</p>

<p>A shadow came over the policeman's honest
face. "Willie is drooping," he said, with a
sigh. "I think it's the loss of the sight of his
mother's face and of the blessed sunlight that's
ailing him. His eyes are quite blind now,&mdash;no
more light to them than if he was in a
pitch-dark cell."</p>

<p>"But I thought the doctor could cure him
when his eyes were all blind," said Bessie.</p>

<p>"Not just now, dear. Next year, maybe,
if all goes well. That's the best we can hope
for, I believe. But here I am standing and
talking to you, when I've business on hand that
can't be put off." So saying, he shook hands
again with Bessie and walked rapidly away.</p>

<p>"I s'pose he means he can't afford to pay
the doctor now," said Bessie, as she and Maggie
went on again with Starr. "Mrs. Granby
said they were pretty poor, and she was 'fraid
they couldn't do it this year. It's so long for
Willie to wait. I wonder if papa wouldn't
pay the doctor."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's the mistress watching for the little
ladies," said Starr, and, looking up, the
children saw Mrs. Rush standing at the window
of her room and nodding to them. In
two minutes more they were at the door,
which she opened for them with even a
brighter face than usual; and, after kissing
them, stood aside to let them see the colonel,
who was coming forward to meet them.</p>

<p>Yes, there he came, and&mdash;no wonder Mrs.
Rush looked bright and happy, no wonder
Starr was smiling&mdash;without his crutches;
moving slowly, to be sure, and leaning on a
cane, but walking on two feet!</p>

<p>If Colonel Rush imagined he was about to
give his little friends a pleasant surprise, he
found he was not mistaken.</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Bessie, but it was in
a very different tone from that in which she
had uttered it once before that day.</p>

<p>Maggie gave a little shriek of delight which
would almost have startled any one who had
not known Maggie's ways, or seen her sparkling
face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! goody! goody! goody!" she exclaimed,
clapping her hands and hopping
about in a kind of ecstasy. "How lovely!
how splendid! how&mdash;how&mdash;superfluous!"
Maggie had been trying to find the longest
"grown-up" word she could think of, and as
she had that morning heard her father say
that something was "altogether superfluous,"
she now used the word without a proper idea
of its meaning.</p>

<p>But the colonel was quite content to take
the word as she meant it, and thanked her for
her joyous sympathy. He knew that Bessie
felt none the less because she was more quiet.
She walked round and round him, looking at
him as if she could not believe it, and then
going up to him, took his hand in both hers,
and laid her smooth, soft cheek upon it in
a pretty, tender way which said more than
words.</p>

<p>"Do let's see you walk a little more," said
Maggie. "It's so nice; it's just like a fairy
tale, when a good fairy comes and mends all
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
the people that have been chopped to pieces,
and makes them just as good as ever; only
this is true and that is not."</p>

<p>"Who put it on?" asked Bessie, meaning
the new leg.</p>

<p>"Starr put it on," answered the colonel.</p>

<p>"And did you make it, too, Starr?"
asked Bessie.</p>

<p>"No, indeed, miss;" said Starr, who still
stood at the door with his hat in his hand,
and his head on one side, looking at his master
much as a proud nurse might look at her
baby who was trying its first steps,&mdash;"no, indeed,
miss; that was beyond me."</p>

<p>"Starr would have given me one of his own,
if he could have done so, I believe," said the
colonel, smiling.</p>

<p>"So would I," said Maggie, "if mine would
have fitted. I think I could do very well with
one foot; I hop a good deal, any way. See, I
could do this way;" and she began hopping
round the table again.</p>

<p>"And you run and skip a good deal," said
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
Mrs. Rush, "and how could you do all that
on one foot?"</p>

<p>Maggie considered a moment. "But I am
very attached to the colonel," she said, "and I
think I could give up one foot if it would be
of use to him."</p>

<p>"I believe you would, my generous little
girl," said the colonel; and Mrs. Rush stooped
and kissed Maggie very affectionately.</p>

<p>"Will that new foot walk in the street?"
asked Maggie.</p>

<p>"Yes, it will walk anywhere when I'm accustomed
to it. But I am a little awkward
just yet, and must practise some before I venture
on it in the street."</p>

<p>It seemed almost too good to be true, that
the colonel should be sitting there with two
feet, which certainly looked quite as well as
papa's or Uncle Ruthven's, or those of any
other gentleman; and it was long before his
affectionate little friends tired of looking at
him and expressing their pleasure.</p>

<p>"We have some very good news for you,"
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
said Bessie; "mamma said we might tell
you."</p>

<p>"Let us have it then," said the colonel;
and the grand secret about Uncle Ruthven
and Aunt Bessie was told.</p>

<p>"I just believe you knew it before," said
Maggie, who thought Colonel and Mrs. Rush
did not seem as much surprised as was to be
expected.</p>

<p>"I am afraid we did, Maggie," said the
colonel, smiling; "but we are none the less
pleased to hear Bessie tell of it."</p>

<p>"But if Uncle Yuthven did it for a favor
to us, why did he not tell us first?" said
Bessie, rather puzzled.</p>

<p>"Well," said the colonel, with a little
twinkle in his eye, "it is just possible that
your Uncle Ruthven took some other people
into consideration,&mdash;myself and Marion, for
instance. Can you not imagine that he
thought it would be very pleasant for us to
be related to you?"</p>

<p>"Will you be our yelations when Uncle
Yuthven marries Aunt Bessie?" asked Bessie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think we shall have to put in some claim
of that sort," said the colonel. "Aunt Bessie
is my sister, and if she becomes your own
aunt, I think my wife and I must also consider
ourselves as belonging to the family.
What should you say to Uncle Horace and
Aunt May?"&mdash;May was the colonel's pet
name for his wife.</p>

<p>It was not likely that either of our little
girls would find fault with this arrangement;
and now it was impossible to say too much in
praise of Uncle Ruthven and his very kind
plan.</p>

<p>The children spent a most delightful day.
Mrs. Rush had ordered an early dinner for
them; after which the carriage came, and all
four&mdash;the colonel and his wife and Maggie
and Bessie&mdash;went for a drive in the Central
Park. It was a lovely afternoon, the air so
soft and sweet with that strange, delicious
scent in it which tells of the coming spring,
and here and there, in some sunny nooks, the
children were delighted to see little patches
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
of green grass. Sparrows and chickadees,
and other birds which make their home with
us during the winter, were hopping merrily
over the leafless branches, and twittering
ceaselessly to one another, as if they were telling
of the happy time near at hand, when the
warm south winds would blow, and the trees
and bushes be covered with their beautiful
green summer dress. Presently Starr, turning
round from his seat on the box beside the
coachman, pointed out a robin, the first robin;
and then Maggie's quick eyes discovered a
second. Yes, there were a pair of them, perking
up their heads and tails, with a saucy,
jaunty air, which seemed to say, "Look at me;
here I am to tell you spring is coming. Are
you not glad to see me?"</p>

<p>And as the carriage drove slowly by, that
the children might watch the birds, one of
them threw back his head and broke into the
sweetest, merriest song, which told the same
pleasant story.</p>

<p>Yes, spring was in the air, and the birdies
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
knew it, though earth as yet showed but few
signs of it.</p>

<p>"He sings just as if he was so glad he
couldn't help it," said Maggie, "and I feel
just like him."</p>

<p>When they drove back to the city, the
children were rather surprised to find they
were taken again to the hotel instead of going
home at once; but Mrs. Rush said, that as the
weather was so mild and pleasant, mamma had
promised they might stay till after dark. This
was a suitable ending to such a very happy
day, especially as it was arranged for them to
take their supper while their friends dined.
Mrs. Rush thought nothing too much trouble
which could give pleasure to these two dear
little girls.</p>

<p>They were listening to one of the colonel's
delightful stories when Mr. Stanton and Miss
Rush came in, with the double purpose of paying
a short visit to the colonel and his wife
and of taking home their young visitors.</p>

<p>Scarcely were they seated when Bessie
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
walked up to Mr. Stanton with "Uncle Er-er-er-Yuthven,"&mdash;Bessie
was trying very hard
for the R's in these days, especially when she
spoke to her uncle,&mdash;"we do thank you so
very much. We think you are the most
obliging gentleman we ever saw."</p>

<p>"Really," said Uncle Ruthven, gravely,
"this is very pleasant to hear. May I ask
who are the 'we' who have such a very high
opinion of me?"</p>

<p>"Why, mamma and the colonel and Mrs.
Yush and Maggie and I; and I s'pose all the
fam'ly who know what a very great favor you
are going to do for us."</p>

<p>"And what is this wonderful favor?" asked
Mr. Stanton.</p>

<p>"To marry Aunt Bessie, so she will be
quite our very own," answered the little girl.
"And then you see that makes my soldier
and Mrs. Yush our own too. They are Uncle
Horace and Aunt May now, for the colonel
said we might as well begin at once. We are
all very, very pleased, Uncle Yuthven, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
Maggie and I think you are the kindest uncle
that ever lived."</p>

<p>"I am glad you have found that out at
last," said Uncle Ruthven. "Here I have
been living for your happiness ever since I
came home, and if I had made this last sacrifice
without your finding out that I am the
best and most generous uncle in the world, it
would have been terrible indeed."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you think it is a sacrifice,"
said Maggie. "I guess you like it 'most as
well as Bessie and I do."</p>

<p>"<i>Does</i> he, Aunt Bessie?" asked little Bessie,
in a tone as if this could not be; at which
Uncle Ruthven's gravity gave way, and the
older people all laughed heartily, though the
children could not see why.</p>

<p class="pmb3">If Bessie had known how to express her
feelings, she would have said that it was Uncle
Ruthven's manner when he was joking
which caused her to "have objections" to
him. When Uncle John was joking, he had
such a merry face that it was quite easy to see
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
what he meant; but Uncle Ruthven always
kept such a sober face and tone that it was
hard to tell whether he were in earnest or no.
And now, when he caught her up in his arms,
and stood her upon the mantel-piece, she felt as
if she still only half approved of him; but it
was not in her heart to find fault with him
just now, and she readily put up her lips for
the kiss which she knew he would claim before
he let her go.</p>

aggie and Bessie," said Mrs. Bradford,
one day soon after this, "I am
going to send Jane over with some
work to Mrs. Granby. Would you like to go
with her and see the policeman's children?"</p>

<p>Bessie answered "Yes," readily enough,
but though Maggie would have liked the long
walk on this lovely day, she was rather doubtful
of the pleasure of calling on those who
were entire strangers to her. But after some
little coaxing from Bessie, who said she would
not go without her, she was at last persuaded,
and they set out with Jane, taking Flossy with
them.</p>

<p>The children had their hooples, which they
trundled merrily before them and Flossy went
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
capering joyously along, sometimes running
ahead, for a short distance, and then rushing
back to his little mistresses, and if any rough
boys made their appearance, keeping very close
at their side till all danger was past. For since
Flossy was stolen, he had been very careful as
to the company he kept, and looked with a
very suspicious eye upon any one who wore
a ragged coat, which was not very just of
Flossy, since a ragged coat may cover as true
and honest a heart as ever beat; but as the
poor puppy knew no better, and had received
some hard treatment at the hands of those
whose miserable garments covered hard and
cruel hearts, he must be excused for thinking
that the one was a sign of the other.</p>

<p>Flossy had turned out quite as pretty a
little dog as he had promised to be. His
coat was long, soft, and silky, and beautifully
marked in brown and white; his drooping
ears hung gracefully on each side of his head,
while his great black eyes were so knowing
and affectionate that it was hard to believe no
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
soul looked out of them. It was no wonder
that almost every child they passed turned to
take a second look, and to wish that they, too,
had such a pretty merry pet. Flossy was in
great favor that day on account of a droll
trick which he had played, much to the
amusement of the children. Harry and Fred
were very anxious to teach him all manner of
things, such as standing on his head, pretending
to be dead, and so forth; but Maggie and
Bessie declared he was too young to be taught
anything except "to be good and polite,"
and would not have him teased. Beside, he
had funny tricks and ways of his own which
they thought much better than those, and was
as full of play and mischief as a petted doggie
could be.</p>

<p>Harry had a weak ankle, which in his boyish
frolics he was constantly hurting, and
now, having given it a slight sprain, he was
laid up on the sofa. On the day before this,
his dinner had been sent to him, but as it did
not exactly suit him, he called Flossy, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
writing on a piece of paper what he desired,
gave it to the dog, and told him to take it to
mamma. He was half doubtful if the creature
would understand; but Flossy ran directly
to the dining-room with the paper in
his mouth, and gave it to Mrs. Bradford. As
a reward for doing his errand so well, she
gave him a piece of cake, although it was
against her rules that he should be fed from
the table.</p>

<p>On this day, Harry had been able to come
down-stairs; and while the children were at
their dinner, Flossy was heard whining at the
door. Patrick opened it, and in he ran with
a crumpled piece of paper, on which Franky
had been scribbling, in his mouth, and going
to Mrs. Bradford held it up to her, wagging
his tail with an air which said quite plainly,
"Here is your paper, now give me my cake."</p>

<p>"Poor little doggie! He did not know
why one piece of paper was not as good as
another, and Mrs. Bradford could not refuse
him, while all the children were quite delighted
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
with his wisdom, and could not make
enough of him for the remainder of the day."</p>

<p>Maggie and Bessie were rather surprised
at the appearance of the policeman's house.
It was so different from those which stood
around it, or from any which they were accustomed
to see in the city; but it looked very
pleasant to them with its green shutters, old-fashioned
porch, and the little courtyard and
great butternut tree in front. The small plot
of grass behind the white palings was quite
green now, and some of the buds on the
hardier bushes were beginning to unfold their
young leaves. Altogether it looked very nice
and homelike, none the less so that Jennie
Richards and her three younger brothers were
playing around, and digging up the fresh
moist earth, with the fancy that they were
making a garden. But their digging was forgotten
when they saw Jane with her little
charge.</p>

<p>"Does Mrs. Granby live here?" asked
Jane, unlatching the gate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," answered Jennie. "Will
you please to walk in?" and opening the
doors, Jennie showed the visitors into the sitting-room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Richards sat sewing, with Willie, as
usual, beside her, rocking ceaselessly back
and forth in his little chair; while good Mrs.
Granby, who had been seated close by the
window, and had seen Jane and the children
come in, was bustling about, placing chairs for
them.</p>

<p>On Willie's knee was a Maltese kitten purring
away contentedly; but the moment she
caught sight of Flossy, she sprang from her
resting-place, and, scampering into a corner,
put up her back, and began spitting and hissing
in a very impolite manner. If Miss Pussy
had been civil, Flossy would probably have
taken no notice of her; but when she drew
attention upon herself by this very rude behavior,
he began to bark and jump about
her, more with a love of teasing than with any
idea of hurting her. It was quite a moment
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
or two before these enemies could be quieted,
and then it was only done by Maggie catching
up Flossy in her arms, and Mrs. Granby
thrusting the kitten into a bureau drawer
with a cuff on its ear.</p>

<p>The commotion being over, with the exception
of an occasional spit from the drawer,
as if kitty were still conscious of the presence
of her foe, Bessie walked up to Mrs. Richards,
and politely holding out her hand, said,
"We came to see you and your fam'ly, ma'am,
and we're sorry to make such a 'sturbance."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Richards, smiling at
what she afterwards called Bessie's old-fashioned
ways,&mdash;"well, I think it was the kitten
was to blame for the disturbance, not you, nor
your pretty dog there; and I'm sure we're all
glad to see you, dear. Are you the little girl
that was lost and taken up to the station?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," said Bessie; "but I was not
taken up 'cause I was naughty, but 'cause I
could not find my way home. Is my policeman
pretty well?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's very well, thank you, dear; but he'll
be mighty sorry to hear you've been here, and
he not home to see you."</p>

<p>"Mother," said Willie, "what a sweet voice
that little girl has! Will she let me touch
her?"</p>

<p>"Would you, dear?" asked Mrs. Richards;
"you see it's the only way he has now of
finding what anybody is like."</p>

<p>"Oh! he may touch me as much as he
likes," said Bessie, and coming close to the
blind boy, she put her hand in his, and waited
patiently while he passed his fingers up her
arm and shoulder, then over her curls, cheek,
and chin; for Willie Richards was already
gaining that quick sense of touch which God
gives to the blind.</p>

<p>The mother's heart was full as she watched
the two children, and saw the tender, pitying
gaze Bessie bent upon her boy.</p>

<p>"Poor Willie!" said the little girl, putting
her arm about his neck, "I am so sorry for
you. But perhaps our Father will let you see
again some day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know," said Willie, sadly; "they
used to say I would be better when the spring
came, but the spring is here now, and it is no
lighter. Oh, it is so very, very dark!"</p>

<p>Bessie's lip quivered, and the tears gathered
in her eyes as she raised them to Mrs. Richards.
But Mrs. Richards turned away her
head. She sometimes thought that Willie had
guessed that the doctor had had hopes of
curing them in the spring, but she had not
the courage to ask him. Nor could she and
his father bear to excite hopes which might
again be disappointed, by telling him to wait
with patience till next year.</p>

<p>But Bessie did not know what made Mrs.
Richards silent, and wondering that she did
not speak, she felt as if she must herself say
something to comfort him.</p>

<p>"But maybe next spring you will see,
Willie," she said.</p>

<p>"Maybe so," said Willie, piteously, "but it
is so long to wait."</p>

<p>Bessie was silent for a moment, not quite
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
knowing what to say; then she spoke again.
"Wouldn't you like to come out and feel
the spring, Willie? It is nice out to-day and
the wind is so pleasant and warm."</p>

<p>"No," answered Willie, almost impatiently,
"I only want to stay here with mother. I
know it feels nice out; but the children come
and say, '<i>See</i> the sky, how blue it is!' and '<i>Look</i>
at this flower,' when I can't see them, and it
makes me feel so bad, so bad. I know the
grass is green and the sky is blue, and the
crocuses and violets are coming out just as
they used to when I could see, but I don't
want them to tell me of it all the time; and
they forget, and it makes me feel worse. But
I wouldn't mind the rest so much if I could
only see mother's face just a little while every
day, then I would be good and patient all the
time. Oh! if I only could see her, just a
moment!"</p>

<p>"Don't, don't, sonny," said his mother, laying
her hand lovingly on his head.</p>

<p>It was the ceaseless burden of his plaintive
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
song,&mdash;"If I only could see mother's face!
If I only could see mother's face!"</p>

<p>"And maybe you will some day, Willie,"
said Bessie; "so try to think about that, and
how she loves you just the same even if you
don't see her. And don't you like to know
the blue sky is there, and that Jesus is behind
it, looking at you and feeling sorry for
you? None of us can see Jesus, but we know
he sees us and loves us all the same; don't
we? Couldn't you feel a little that way about
your mother, Willie?"</p>

<p>"I'll try," said Willie, with the old patient
smile coming back again.</p>

<p>Poor Willie! It was not usual for him to
be impatient or fretful. But he had been
sadly tried that day in the way he had spoken
of, and the longing for his lost sight was
almost too great to be borne. But now Mrs.
Granby, suspecting something of what was
going on on that side of the room, came bustling
up to Willie and Bessie, bringing Maggie
with her. Maggie had been making acquaintance
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
with Jennie while Bessie was talking with
the blind boy.</p>

<p>"Willie," said Mrs. Granby, "here's just
the prettiest little dog that ever lived, and
he is as tame and gentle as can be. If Miss
Maggie don't object, maybe he'd lie a bit on
your knee, and let you feel his nice long ears
and silken hair."</p>

<p>"Yes, take him," said Maggie, putting her
dog into Willie's arms.</p>

<p>Flossy was not usually very willing to go to
strangers; but now, perhaps, his doggish instinct
told him that this poor boy had need of
pity and kindness. However that was, he lay
quietly in Willie's clasp, and looking wistfully
into his sightless eyes, licked his hands
and face.</p>

<p>Maggie and Bessie were delighted, and began
to tell Willie of Flossy's cunning ways.
The other children gathered about to listen
and admire too, and presently Willie laughed
outright as they told of his cute trick with the
crumpled paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>And now, whether Miss Kitty saw through
the crack of the drawer that her young master
was fondling a new pet, or whether she
only guessed at it, or whether she thought it
hard that fun should be going on in which she
had no share, cannot be told; but just then
there came from her prison-place such a hissing
and sputtering and scratching that every
one of the children set up a shout of laughter.
Not since his blindness came upon him had his
mother heard Willie's voice sound so gleeful,
and now in her heart she blessed the dear
little girl who she felt had done him good.
Then as the children begged for her, kitty was
released; but as she still showed much ill-temper,
Mrs. Granby was obliged to put her in
the other room.</p>

<p>Soon after this our little girls, with their
nurse, took leave, having presented Willie
with a new book, and his mother with some
useful things mamma had sent, and giving
Willie and Jennie an invitation to come and
see them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>They did not go back as joyfully as they had
come. Somehow, in spite of the good laugh
they had had, the thought of blind Willie
made them feel sad, and giving Jane their
hooples to carry, they walked quietly by her
side, hand in hand.</p>

<p>Bessie was half heart-broken as she told her
mamma of the blind boy's longing to see his
mother's face, and neither she nor Maggie
quite recovered their usual spirits for the remainder
of the day. Mamma was almost
sorry she had allowed them to go.</p>

<p>"And what makes my princess so sad this
evening?" asked Uncle Ruthven, lifting Bessie
upon his knee.</p>

<p>"Don't you think you'd be very sad, sir, if
you were blind?"</p>

<p>"Doubtless I should, dear. I think, of all
my senses, my sight is the one I prize most,
and for which I am most thankful. But you
are not going to lose your sight; are you,
Bessie?"</p>

<p>"No," said Bessie; "but Willie Richards
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
has lost his. He is quite, quite blind, uncle,
and can't see his mother's face; and they
can't let the doctor cure him, 'cause they are
too poor. Maggie and I wished to help them
very much, and we wanted to ask them to
take all the glove-money we have,&mdash;that is
what mamma lets us have to do charity with,&mdash;but
mamma says it would not be much
help, and she thinks we had better keep it to
buy some little thing Willie may need. And
we are very grieved for him."</p>

<p>"Poor little princess!" said Mr. Stanton.
"And why did you not come to me for help?
What is the good of having an old uncle with
plenty of money in his pockets, if you do not
make him 'do charity' for you? Let me see.
How comes on the history of the 'Complete
Family,' Maggie?"</p>

<p>"Oh! it's 'most finished," said Maggie.
"At least, that book is; but we are going to
have another volume. Mamma likes us to
write it. She says it is good practice, and
will make it easy for us to write compositions
by and by."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very sensible of mamma," said Mr. Stanton.
"But I think you said you wished to
sell it when it was finished, so that you might
help the poor."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, you know I am going away to-morrow
morning,&mdash;going to take Aunt Bessie to
Baltimore to see her sister. We shall be gone
about a week. If your book is finished when
we come home, I shall see if I cannot find
a purchaser for it. And you might use the
money for the blind boy if you like."</p>

<p>Just at this moment nurse put her head in
at the door with "Come along, my honeys.
Your mamma is waiting up-stairs for you,
and it's your bed-time."</p>

<p>"In one instant, mammy," said Mr. Stanton.
"Is it a bargain, little ones? If I find
a man to buy your book, will you have it
ready, and trust it to me, when I come
back?"</p>

<p>The children were willing enough to agree
to this; and Maggie only wished that it was
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
not bed-time, so that she might finish the
book that very night. Uncle Ruthven said
they would talk more about it when he returned,
and bade them "Good-night."</p>

<p>"My darlings," said mamma, when they
went up-stairs, "I do not want you to distress
yourselves about blind Willie. When the time
comes for the doctor to perform the operation
on his eyes, I think the means will be found
to pay him. But you are not to say anything
about it at present. I only tell you because I
do not like to see you unhappy."</p>

<p>"Are you or papa going to do it, mamma?"
asked Bessie.</p>

<p>"We shall see," said Mrs. Bradford, with a
smile.</p>

<p class="pmb3">"Perhaps we can help you a little," said
Maggie, joyfully; and she told her mother of
her uncle's proposal about the book.</p>

ncle Ruthven and Aunt Bessie
went away the next morning, and
were gone nearly a week, and very
much did the children miss them, especially
as the week proved one of storm and rain, and
they were shut up in the house.</p>

<p>During all this stormy weather Aunt Patty
seemed very anxious to go out, watching for
the first glimpse of sunshine. But none came,
and at last, one morning when there was a
fine, drizzling rain, she came down dressed
for a walk. Mrs. Bradford was much astonished,
for Mrs. Lawrence was subject to rheumatism,
and it was very imprudent for her to
go out in the damp. In vain did Mrs. Bradford
offer to send a servant on any errand she
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
might wish to have done. Aunt Patty would
not listen to it for a moment, nor would she
allow a carriage to be sent for, nor tell where
she was going.</p>

<p>She stayed a long time, and when the boys
ran home from school in the midst of a hard
shower, they were surprised to meet her just
getting out of a carriage which had drawn up
around the corner. Aunt Patty did not seem
at all pleased to see them, and in answer to
their astonished inquiries, "Why, Aunt Patty!
where have you been?" and "Why don't
you let the carriage leave you at the house?"
answered, sharply, "When I was young, old
people could mind their own affairs without
help from school-boys."</p>

<p>"Not without help from school-<i>girls</i>, when
<i>she</i> was around, I guess," whispered Fred to
his brother, as they fell behind, and let the
old lady march on.</p>

<p>Nor was she more satisfactory when she
reached home, and seemed only desirous to
avoid Mrs. Bradford's kind inquiries and anxiety
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
lest she should have taken cold. This was
rather strange, for it was not Aunt Patty's way
to be mysterious, and she was generally quite
ready to let her actions be seen by the whole
world. But certainly no one would have
guessed from her manner that she had that
morning been about her Master's work.</p>

<p>Uncle Ruthven and Aunt Bessie came home
that afternoon, and found no reason to doubt
their welcome.</p>

<p>"We're very glad to see you, Uncle Er-er
<i>R</i>uthven," said Bessie, bringing out the <i>R</i>
quite clearly.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" said her uncle, "so you have
come to it at last; have you? You have been
learning to talk English while I was away.
Pretty well for my princess! What reward
shall I give you for that <i>R</i>uthven?"</p>

<p>"I don't want a reward," said the little
princess, gayly. "I tried to learn it 'cause I
thought you wanted me to; and you are so
kind to us I wanted to please you. Besides, I
am growing pretty old, and I ought to learn
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
to talk plain. Why, Uncle Ruthven, I'll be
six years old when I have a birthday in May,
and the other day we saw a little girl,&mdash;she
was blind Willie's sister,&mdash;and she couldn't
say <i>th</i>, though she is 'most seven; and I thought
it sounded pretty foolish; and then I thought
maybe it sounded just as foolish for me not to
say <i>r</i>, so I tried and tried, and Maggie helped
me."</p>

<p>"Uncle Ruthven," said Maggie, coming to
his side, and putting her arm about his neck,
she whispered in his ear, "did you ever find a
man to buy my book?"</p>

<p>"To be sure," said Mr. Stanton, "a first-rate
fellow, who promised to take it at once.
He would like to know how much you want
for it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Maggie; "how much
can he afford?"</p>

<p>"Ah! you answer my question by another.
Well, he is pretty well off, that fellow, and I
think he will give you sufficient to help along
that blind friend of yours a little. We will
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
not talk of that just now, however, but when
you go up-stairs, I will come up and see you,
and we will settle it all then."</p>

<p>"Here is a prize," said Mr. Stanton, coming
into the parlor some hours later, when the
children had all gone; and he held up Maggie's
history of the "Complete Family."</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Colonel Rush, who
with his wife had come to welcome his sister.</p>

<p>Mr. Stanton told the story of the book.</p>

<p>"But how came it into your hands?" asked
Mr. Bradford.</p>

<p>"Oh, Maggie and I struck a bargain to-night,"
said Mr. Stanton, laughing, "and the
book is mine to do as I please with."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ruthven, Ruthven!" said his sister,
coming in as he spoke, and passing her hand
affectionately through his thick, curly locks,
"you have made two happy hearts to-night.
Nor will the stream of joy you have set flowing
stop with my little ones. That poor blind
child and his parents&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, there, that will do," said Mr.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
Stanton, playfully putting his hand on Mrs.
Bradford's lips. "Sit down here, Margaret.
I shall give you all some passages from Maggie's
book. If I am not mistaken, it will be a
rich treat."</p>

<p>Poor little Maggie! She did not dream, as
she lay happy and contented on her pillow,
how merry they were all making over her
"Complete Family," as Uncle Ruthven read
aloud from it such passages as these.</p>

<p>"The Happy father and mother brought up
their children in the way they should go, but
sometimes the children went out of it, which
was not the blame of their kind parents,
for they knew better, and they ought to be
ashamed of themselves, and it is a great blessing
for children to have parents.</p>

<p>"The colonel had a new leg, not a skin one,
but a man made it, but you would not know
it, it looks so real, and he can walk with it
and need not take his crutches, and the souls
of M. and B. Happy were very glad because
this was a great rejoicing, and it is not a blessing
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
to be lame, but to have two legs is, and
when people have a great many blessings, they
ought to 'praise God from whom all blessings
flow;' but they don't always, which is very
wicked.</p>

<p>"This very Complete Family grew completer
and completer, for the travelling uncle
married Aunt Bessie, I mean he is going to
marry her, so she will be our own aunt and
not just a make b'lieve, and all the family are
very glad and are very much obliged to him
for being so kind, but I don't think he is a
great sacrifice.</p>

<p>"M. and B. Happy went to see the policeman's
children. Blind Willie was sorrowful
and can't see his mother, or anything, which
is no consequence, if he could see his mother's
face, for if M. Happy and B. Happy could not
see dear mamma's face they would cry all the
time. I mean M. would, but Bessie is better
than me so maybe she would not, and Willie
is very patient, and the cat was very abominable,
and if Flossy did so, Bessie and I would
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
be disgraced of him. She humped up her
back and was cross, so Mrs. Granby put her
in the drawer, but she put a paw out of the
crack and spit and scratched and did 'most
everything. Oh! such a bad cat!!!!!! Jennie
she cannot say th, and afterwards I laughed
about it, but Bessie said I ought not, because
she cannot say r and that was 'most the same.
And she is going to try and say Uncle
Ruthven's name quite plain and hard, he is so
very good to us, and he promised to find a man
to buy this book, and we hope the man will
give five dollars to be a great help for blind
Willie's doctor. I suppose he will ask everybody
in the cars if they want to buy a book to
print, that somebody of his wrote, but he is
not going to tell our name because I asked
him not to."</p>

<p>The book ended in this way:&mdash;</p>

<p>"These are not all the acts of the Complete
Family, but there will be another book with
some more. Adieu. And if you don't know
French, that means good-by. The end of the
book!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pretty well for seven years old, I think,"
said Mr. Bradford. "Mamma, did you lend a
helping hand?"</p>

<p>"Only to correct the spelling," said Mrs.
Bradford; "the composition and ideas are entirely
Maggie's own, with a little help from
Bessie. I have not interfered save once or
twice when she has chosen some subject I did
not think it best she should write on. Both
she and Bessie have taken so much pleasure
in it that I think it would have been a real
trial to part with the book except for some
such object as they have gained."</p>

<p>"And what is that?" asked Colonel Rush.</p>

<p>"The sum Dr. Dawson asks for the cure
of Willie Richards," answered Mrs. Bradford,
"which sum this dear brother of mine is allowing
to pass through the hands of these
babies of mine, as their gift to the blind
child."</p>

<p>"Aunt Patty," said Bessie at the breakfast-table
the next morning,&mdash;"Aunt Patty, did
you hear what Uncle Ruthven did for us?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I heard," said the old lady, shortly.</p>

<p>"And don't you feel very happy with us?"
asked the little darling, who was anxious that
every one should rejoice with herself and
Maggie; but she spoke more timidly than
she had done at first, and something of her
old fear of Aunt Patty seemed to come over
her.</p>

<p>"I do not think it at all proper that children
should be allowed to have such large
sums of money," said Mrs. Lawrence, speaking
not to Bessie, but to Mrs. Bradford. "I
thought your brother a more sensible man,
Margaret. Such an ill-judged thing!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Bradford was vexed, as she saw the
bright face of her little daughter become overcast,
still she tried to speak pleasantly. Something
had evidently gone wrong with Aunt
Patty.</p>

<p>"I do not think you will find Ruthven
wanting in sense or judgment, Aunt Patty,"
she said, gently. "And the sum you speak
of is for a settled purpose. It only passes
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
through my children's hands, and is not
theirs to waste or spend as they may please."</p>

<p>"And if it was, we would rather give it
to blind Willie, mamma," said Bessie, in a
grieved and half-angry voice.</p>

<p>"I am sure of it, my darling," said mamma,
with a nod and smile which brought comfort
to the disappointed little heart. Ah, the
dear mamma! they were all sure of sympathy
from her whether in joy or sorrow. Aunt
Patty's want of it had been particularly hard
on Bessie, for the dear child saw the old lady
did not look half pleased that morning, and
she had spoken as much from a wish to cheer
her as for her own sake and Maggie's.</p>

<p>"It is all wrong, decidedly wrong!" continued
Mrs. Lawrence. "In my young days
things were very different. Children were
not then allowed to take the lead in every
way, and to think they could do it as well or
better than their elders. The proper thing
for you to do, Margaret, is to put by that
money till your children are older and better
able to judge what they are doing."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think they understand that now, Aunt
Patty," said Mrs. Bradford, quietly, but
firmly; "and if they should not, I suppose
you will allow that their parents are able to
judge for them. Henry and I understand all
the merits of the present case."</p>

<p>Aunt Patty was not to be convinced, and
she talked for some time, growing more and
more vexed as she saw her words had no
effect. Mr. and Mrs. Bradford were silent,
for they knew it was of no use to argue with
the old lady when she was in one of these
moods; but they wished that the meal was at
an end, and the children were out of hearing.</p>

<p>And there sat Miss Rush, too, wondering
and indignant, and only kept from replying to
Aunt Patty by Mrs. Bradford's beseeching
look. But at last Mr. Bradford's patience
was at an end, and in a firm, decided manner,
he requested the old lady to say nothing more
on the subject, but to leave it to be settled by
his wife and himself.</p>

<p>If there was any person in the world of
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
whom Mrs. Lawrence stood in awe, it was
her nephew; and she knew when he spoke in
that tone, he meant to be obeyed. Therefore,
she was silent, but sat through the remainder
of breakfast with a dark and angry face.</p>

<p>"Papa," said Maggie, as her father rose
from the table, "do you think there is the
least, least hope that it will clear to-day?"</p>

<p>"Well, I see some signs of it, dear; but
these April days are very uncertain. Of one
thing be sure, if the weather be at all fit, I
will come home and take you where you want
to go."</p>

<p>"Are you tired of being shut up in the
house so long, dear Midget?" asked Aunt
Bessie, putting her arm about Maggie, and
drawing her to her side.</p>

<p>"Yes, pretty tired, Aunt Bessie; but that
is not the reason why Bessie and I wish so
very much to have it clear. Papa told us, if
the weather was pleasant, he would take us to
the policeman's, and let us give the money
ourselves. But he says, if it keeps on raining,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
he thinks it would be better to send it,
because it is not kind to keep them waiting
when they feel so badly about Willie, and
this will make them so glad. I suppose it is
not very kind, but we want very much to
take it, and see Mrs. Richards how pleased
she will be."</p>

<p>"We will hope for the best," said Mr.
Bradford, cheerfully; "and I think it may
turn out a pleasant day. But my little daughters
must not be too much disappointed if the
rain keeps on. And now that I may be ready
for clear skies and dry pavements, I must go
down town at once."</p>

<p>No sooner had the door closed after Mr.
Bradford than Aunt Patty broke forth again.
"Margaret," she said, severely, "it is not possible
that you mean to add to your folly by
letting your children go to that low place, after
such weather as we have had! You don't
know what you may expose them to, especially
that delicate child, whom you can never
expect to be strong while you are so shamefully
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
careless of her;" and she looked at Bessie,
who felt very angry.</p>

<p>"That will be as their father thinks best,"
answered Mrs. Bradford, quietly. "He will
not take them unless the weather is suitable;
and the policeman's house is neat and comfortable,
and in a decent neighborhood. The
children will come to no harm there."</p>

<p>"And it is certainly going to clear," said
Harry. "See there, mamma, how it is brightening
overhead."</p>

<p>"It will not clear for some hours at least,"
persisted the old lady; "and then the ground
will be extremely damp after this week of
rain, especially among those narrow streets.
Do be persuaded, Margaret, and say, at least,
that the children must wait till to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Bessie shall not go unless it is quite safe
for her," answered Mrs. Bradford, "and she
will not ask it unless mamma thinks it best;
will you, my darling?"</p>

<p>Bessie only replied with a smile, and a very
feeble smile at that; and her mother saw by
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
the crimson spot in each cheek, and the little
hand pressed tightly upon her lips, how hard
the dear child was struggling with herself. It
was so. Bessie was hurt at what she thought
Aunt Patty's unkindness in trying to deprive
her of the pleasure on which she counted, and
she had hard work to keep down the rising
passion.</p>

<p>Aunt Patty argued, persisted, and persuaded;
but she could gain from Mrs. Bradford
nothing more than she had said before,
and at last she left the room in high displeasure.</p>

<p>"Mamma," said Harry, indignantly, "what
do you stand it for? How dare she talk so
to you? Your folly, indeed! I wish papa
had been here!"</p>

<p>"I wish you'd let me hush her up," said
Fred. "It's rather hard for a fellow to stand
by and have his mother spoken to that way.
Now is she not a meddling, aggravating old
coon, Aunt Bessie? No, you need not shake
your head in that grave, reproving way. I
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
know you think so; and you, too, you dear,
patient little mamma;" and here Fred gave
his mother such a squeeze and kiss as would
have made any one else cry out for mercy.</p>

<p>"I sha'n't try to bear Aunt Patty's burden
this day, I know," said Maggie. "She is <i>too</i>
mean not to want blind Willie cured, and it
is not any of hers to talk about, either. Her
corners are awful to-day! Just trying to
make mamma say Bessie couldn't go to the
policeman's house!"</p>

<p>Bessie said nothing, but her mamma saw
she was trying to keep down her angry feelings.</p>

<p>"I suppose she is tired of the 'new leaf'
she pretended to have turned over, and don't
mean to play good girl any more," said Fred.</p>

<p>"She has been worrying papa too," said Harry.
"There is never any knowing what she'll
be at. There was a grove which used to belong
to her father, and which had been sold by one
of her brothers after he died. It was a favorite
place with our great-grandfather, and Aunt
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
Patty wanted it back very much, but she
never could persuade the man who had
bought it to give it up. A few years ago he
died, and his son offered to sell it to her. She
could not afford it then, for she had lost a
great deal of property, and the mean chap
asked a very large sum for it because he knew
she wanted it so much. But she was determined
to have it, and for several years she has
been putting by little by little till she should
have enough. She told Fred and me all
about it, one evening when papa and mamma
were out, and we felt so sorry for her when
she told how her father had loved the place,
and how she could die contented if she only
had it back once more after all these years,
that we asked papa if he could not help her.
Papa said he would willingly do so, but she
would not be pleased if he offered, though
she had so set her heart on it that she was
denying herself everything she could possibly
do without; for she is not well off now,
and is too proud to let her friends help her
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
Well, it seems she had enough laid by at last,&mdash;a
thousand dollars,&mdash;and she asked papa
to settle it all for her. He wrote to the man,
and had a lot of fuss and bother with him;
but it was all fixed at last, and the papers
drawn up, when what does she do a week
ago, but tell papa she had changed her mind,
and should not buy the grove at present."</p>

<p>"Harry, my boy," said Mrs. Bradford,
"this is all so, but how do you happen to
know so much about it?"</p>

<p>"Why, she talked to me several times about
it, mamma. She was quite chipper with Fred
and me now and then, when no grown people
were around, and used to tell us stories of
things which happened at the old homestead by
the hour. The other day when you were out,
and Mag and Bess had gone to the policeman's,
she told me it was all settled that she
was to have the grove; and she seemed so
happy over it. But only two days after, when
I said something about it, she took me up
quite short, and told me that affair was all
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
over, and no more to be said. I didn't dare
to ask any more questions of her, but I
thought it no harm to ask papa, and he told
me he knew no more than I did, for Aunt
Patty would give him no reason. He was
dreadfully annoyed by it, I could see, although
he did not say much; he never does,
you know, when he is vexed."</p>

<p>"Quite true," said his mother; "and let
him be an example to the rest of us. We
have all forgotten ourselves a little in the vexations
of the morning. You have been saying
that which was better left unsaid, and your
mother has done wrong in listening to you."</p>

<p>"No, indeed, you have not," said Fred,
again clutching his mother violently about
the neck; "you never do wrong, you dear,
precious mamma, and I'll stand up for you
against all the cross old Aunt Pattys in creation."</p>

<p>"My dear boy," gasped his mother, "if you
could leave my head on, it would be a greater
convenience than fighting on my account with
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
Aunt Patty. And your mother must be very
much on her guard, Fred, if a thing is to be
judged right by you because she does it. But,
dearest children, did we not all determine not
to allow ourselves to be irritated and vexed by
such things as have taken place this morning?
This is almost the first trial of the kind we
have had. Let us be patient and forgiving,
and try to think no more of it."</p>

<p>But it was in vain that Mrs. Bradford
coaxed and persuaded, and even reproved.
Her children obeyed, and were silent when
she forbade any more to be said on the subject;
but she could not do away with the
impression which Aunt Patty's ill-temper and
interference had made.</p>

<p>Poor Aunt Patty! She had practised a
great piece of self-denial, had given up a
long-cherished hope, that she might have the
means of doing a very kind action; but she
did not choose to have it known by her
friends. And having made up her mind to
this, and given up so much to bring it about,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
it did seem hard that her arrangements should
be interfered with, as they seemed likely to be
by this new plan which had come to her ears
the night before.</p>

<p>But now as she stood alone in her own
room, taking herself to task for the ill-temper
she had just shown, she felt that it would be
still harder for the children; she could not allow
them to be disappointed if it were still possible
to prevent it; that would be too cruel
now that she saw so plainly how much they had
set their hearts upon this thing. At first it
had seemed to her, as she said, much better
that they should put by the money until they
were older, but now she saw it was the
desire to carry out her own will which had
led her to think this. But Aunt Patty was
learning to give up her own will, slowly and
with difficulty it might be, with many a struggle,
many a failure, as had been shown this
morning; but still, thanks to the whispers of
the better spirit by whose teachings she had
lately been led, she was taking to heart the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
lesson so hard to learn because so late begun.</p>

<p>And now how was she to undo what she
had done, so that Maggie and Bessie might
still keep this matter in their own hands? For
Aunt Patty, hearing the little ones talk so
much of the blind boy and his parents, had
become quite interested in the policeman's
family. She did not know them, it was true,
had never seen one of them, but the children's
sympathy had awakened hers, and she
felt a wish to do something to help them; but
to do this to much purpose was not very easy
for Mrs. Lawrence. She was not rich, and
what she gave to others she must take from
her own comforts and pleasures. What a good
thing it would be to pay Dr. Dawson and free
the policeman from debt! What happiness this
would bring to those poor people! What pleasure
it would give little Maggie and Bessie!
But how could she do it? She had not the
means at present, unless, indeed, she put off
the purchase of the grove for a year or two,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
and took part of the sum she had so carefully
laid by for that purpose, and if she did so, she
might never have back the grove. She was
very old, had not probably many years to live,
and she might pass away before the wished-for
prize was her own. And these people were
nothing to her; why should she make such a
sacrifice for them?</p>

<p>So thought Aunt Patty, and then said to
herself, if she had but a short time upon earth,
was there not more reason that she should
spend it in doing all she could for her Master's
service, in helping those of his children on
whom he had laid pain and sorrows? She had
been wishing that she might be able to prove
her love and gratitude for the great mercy
that had been shown to her, that she might
yet redeem the wasted years, the misspent life
which lay behind her, and now when the Lord
had given her the opportunity for which she
had been longing, should she turn her back
upon it, should she shut her ear to the cry of
the needy, because to answer it would cost a
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
sacrifice of her own wishes? Should she bear
the burdens of others only when they did not
weigh heavily on herself?</p>

<p>And so the old lady had gone to Dr. Dawson
and paid him the sum he asked for curing
Willie's eyes. What more she had done will
be shown hereafter. If the children had
known this, perhaps they could have guessed
why she would not buy the grove after all
papa's trouble. There were several reasons
why Mrs. Lawrence had chosen to keep all
this a secret; partly from a really honest desire
not to parade her generosity in the eyes of
men, partly because she thought that Mr.
Bradford might oppose it, and fearing the
strength of her own resolution, she did not
care to have it shaken by any persuasions
to the contrary, and partly because she had
always rather prided herself on carrying out
her own plans without help or advice from
others. This fear that she might be tempted
to change her purpose had also made Aunt
Patty so anxious to bring it to an end at once,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
and had taken her out in the rain on the day before
this. And now it seemed that her trouble
so far as regarded Dr. Dawson was all thrown
away. But the question was, how should she
get the money back from the doctor without
betraying herself to him or some of the family?
for this Aunt Patty was quite determined not
to do. It was not a pleasant task to ask him
to return the money she had once given, and
that without offering any reason save that
she had changed her mind. Every limb was
aching with the cold taken from her exposure
of yesterday, and now if she was to be in time,
she must go out again in the damp. True, it
was not raining now, but there was another
heavy cloud coming up in the south; she
should surely be caught in a fresh shower.
If she could have persuaded Mrs. Bradford to
keep the children at home until the next day,
she could go to Dr. Dawson that afternoon if
the weather were clear, and so escape another
wetting. For the doctor had told her he did
not think he could see the policeman before
the evening of that day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>But Margaret was "obstinate," said the old
lady, forgetting that she herself was a little
obstinate in keeping all this a secret. So
there was nothing for it but to go at once.</p>

<p>Poor old lady! Perhaps it was not to be
wondered at that, as she moved about the room,
making ready to go out, she should again feel
irritable and out of humor. She was in much
pain. The plans which had cost her so much,
and which she had thought would give such
satisfaction, were all disarranged. She was
vexed at being misjudged by those from whom
she had so carefully concealed what she had
done, for she saw plainly enough that they all
thought her opposition of the morning was
owing to the spirit of contradiction she had so
often shown. She was vexed at herself, vexed
with Mrs. Bradford, vexed even with the little
ones whom she could not allow to be disappointed,
and just for the moment she could
not make up her mind to be reasonable and
look at things in their right light.</p>

<p>Nor were her troubles yet at an end. As
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
she left the room, she met Mrs. Bradford, who,
seeing that she was going out again, once
more tried to dissuade her from such imprudence,
but all to no purpose. Aunt Patty was
very determined and rather short, and
went on her way down-stairs.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Bradford entered her nursery,
mammy, who had heard all that had passed,
said, with the freedom of an old and privileged
servant,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Eh, my dear, but she's contrary. She's
just hunting up a fit of rheumatics, that you
may have the trouble of nursing her through
it."</p>

<p class="pmb3">Mrs. Lawrence heard the old woman's improper
speech, but did not hear Mrs. Bradford's
gently spoken reproof, and we may be sure the
first did not help to restore her good-humor.</p>

</span>
essie's high spirits had all flown
away. The scene with Aunt Patty,
and the fear that the weather would
not allow Maggie and herself to carry Uncle
Ruthven's gift to blind Willie, on which pleasure,
in spite of her father's warning, she had
quite set her mind, were enough to sadden
that sensitive little heart. More than this, she
was very much hurt at what Aunt Patty had
said of her mother. <i>She</i>, that dear, precious
mamma, always so tender and devoted, so
careful of her by night and day, to be so
spoken of! No one else had ever dared to
speak so to mamma in her hearing, and she
did not feel as if she could forgive it. Poor
little soul! she was very indignant, but she
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
kept down her anger, and all she had allowed
herself to say had been, "She would not like
to be blind herself a whole year; but she has
not a bit of <i>symphethy</i>." At which long word
mamma could not help smiling; but as she
looked at the grieved face, she felt as if she
could scarcely keep her own patience.</p>

<p>"Come here, Bessie," said Miss Rush, who
was sitting by the window, "I have something
to show you; see there," as Bessie climbed
upon her lap. "A few moments since I saw
a break in the clouds, and a bit of blue sky
peeping out. I did not call you right away,
lest you should be disappointed again; but
the blue is spreading and spreading, so I think
we may hope for a fine day, after all. And
see, there is the sun struggling through. Ah,
I think you will have your walk with papa."</p>

<p>Yes, there came the sun shining quite
brightly now, and the pools of water on the
sidewalk began to dance in his beams as if
they were saying, "How do you do, Mr. Sun?
We are glad to see you after a week's absence,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
even though you do mean to make us
disappear beneath your warm rays."</p>

<p>Bessie watched for a few moments, and then
ran to find Maggie, who had gone up-stairs
with mamma for a new story-book which Aunt
Bessie had promised to read for them.</p>

<p>"Maggie, Maggie!" she called from the foot
of the stairs, "come and see how the blue sky
is coming out and how the sun is shining;"
and as she spoke, Maggie ran along the upper
hall, and came down, saying, dolefully,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Bessie! I saw it up-stairs, and I went
to the window to look, and there's a great
cloud coming over the sun. There, see! he's
all gone now. I just believe it is going to
rain again."</p>

<p>It was too true, and as the little girls ran
to the front-door, and Maggie drew aside the
lace which covered the large panes of glass in
the upper part, so that they might peep out,
they saw that the blue sky had disappeared,
and a moment later, down splashed the heavy
drops of rain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>Bessie felt a great choking in her throat,
and Maggie said, impatiently, "It is <i>never</i> going
to clear up; I know it. It just rains this
way to provoke poor children who want to go
out."</p>

<p>"Maggie, darling, who sends the rain?"
came in Aunt Bessie's gentle tone through
the open parlor-door, and at the same moment
a stern voice behind the children
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are very naughty, child. Do you remember
that God hears you when you say
such wicked words?"</p>

<p>Both children turned with a start to see
Mrs. Lawrence in hat and cloak, and with an
enormous umbrella in her hand.</p>

<p>"No," she said, severely, as poor frightened
Maggie shrank before the glance of her eye,
"you will not go out to-day, nor do you deserve
it."</p>

<p>Then Bessie's anger broke forth. "You
are bad, you're cruel!" she said, stamping
her foot, and with her face crimson with passion.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
"You want poor Willie to be blind all
his life. You don't want him to be well, even
when our Father&mdash;"</p>

<p>What more she would have said will never
be known, save by Him who reads all hearts;
for as these last two words passed her lips, she
checked herself, and rushing to Aunt Bessie,
who had gone to the parlor-door at the sound
of Mrs. Lawrence's voice, buried her face in
the folds of her dress.</p>

<p>"Our Father!" Was she his little child
now when in her fury and passion she had
forgotten that his holy eye rested upon her,
when she was grieving and offending him?
Such was the thought that had stopped her,
even as she poured forth those angry words.
For one moment she stood with her face hidden,
sending up a silent, hurried prayer to the
Great Helper, then turning to Aunt Patty,
she said, with a touching meekness,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Please forgive me, Aunt Patty. I didn't
try hard enough that time; but I'll try not to
do so again. The wicked passion came so
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
quick;" and then she hid her face once more
against Miss Rush.</p>

<p>Yes, the passion had come quickly, but it
had been quickly conquered, and as Aunt
Patty looked at her, these words came to her
mind: "Greater is he that ruleth his spirit
than he that taketh a city;" and she stood
humbled before this little child. Turning
away without a word, she opened the front-door
and passed out, while Miss Rush led the
children back to the parlor.</p>

<p>Aunt Bessie's own eyes glistened as she
lifted the sobbing child upon her lap, while
Maggie stood beside her, holding Bessie's
hand in one of her own, and with her pocket-handkerchief
wiping the tears that streamed
from her little sister's eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, it has been such a bad day, and we
thought it was going to be such a nice one,
didn't we?" said Bessie. "We were so very
glad when we woke up this morning, and we
have had such very <i>misable</i> times all day, and
now I was so naughty. And I did ask for
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
help to be good, too, this morning. Aunt
Bessie, why didn't it come?"</p>

<p>"I think it did come, darling," said Aunt
Bessie. "If it had not, you could not have
conquered yourself as you did the moment
you remembered you were displeasing your
heavenly Father. If you forgot for a moment,
and your temper overcame you, I think he
knew how you had struggled with it this
morning, and so pitied and forgave, sending
the grace and strength you needed as soon as
you saw your own want of it."</p>

<p>"It's all Aunt Patty's fault, anyhow," said
Maggie. "She provoked us, hateful old
thing! I know I ought not to say that about
the rain, Aunt Bessie, 'cause it's God's rain,
and he can send it if he chooses; but it was
not her business to meddle about, and I am a
great deal more sorry for your speaking so
kind than for all the scolding. I just wish&mdash;I
wish&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I would not wish any bad wishes for
Aunt Patty, dear," said Miss Rush. "That
will not help any of us to feel better."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know about that," said Maggie,
gravely shaking her head. "I think I'd feel
more comfortable in my mind if I wished
something about her. I think I'll have to do
it, Aunt Bessie."</p>

<p>"Then wish only that she were a little
more amiable, or did not speak quite so
sharply," said Miss Rush, smiling at Maggie's
earnestness.</p>

<p>"Oh, pooh! that's no good," said Maggie.
"She never will learn to behave herself. I'll
tell you, I just wish she was a Lot's wife."</p>

<p>"Lot's wife?" said Miss Rush.</p>

<p>"I mean Lot's wife after she 'came a pillar
of salt, and then maybe she'd be all soaked
away in this pouring rain, and no more left of
her to come back again and bother us."</p>

<p>There was never any telling where Maggie's
ideas would carry her, and at the thought of
the droll fate she had imagined for Aunt
Patty, Miss Rush fairly laughed outright, and
even Bessie smiled, after which she said she
would go up-stairs and talk a little to her
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
mother, which always did her good when she
was in trouble.</p>

<p>This shower proved the last of the rain for
that day, and by twelve o'clock the clouds had
all rolled away and the pavements were drying
rapidly, giving fresh hope to Maggie and
Bessie that they would be able to go over to
the policeman's house; but before that Aunt
Patty had returned. She was very silent,
almost sad, and the many troubled looks she
cast towards the little girls made Mrs. Bradford
think that she was sorry for her unkindness
of the morning.</p>

<p>This was so, but there was more than that
to trouble the old lady, for her errand to Dr.
Dawson had been fruitless. When she reached
his house, he was out, but she sat down to
wait for him. He soon came in and without
waiting for her to speak, told her that, having
an hour to spare, he had just been up to the
police-station to give Richards the good news.</p>

<p>So it was too late after all, for now that the
policeman knew of her gift, Mrs. Lawrence
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
could not make up her mind to ask it back.
Then the doctor asked her if she had any further
business with him, to which she answered
"No," and walked away, leaving him to think
what a very odd old lady she was, and to say
indignantly that he believed "she had not
trusted him, and had come to see that he kept
faith with her."</p>

<p>"Bradford," said Mr. Stanton, as he stood
in his brother-in-law's office that morning,
"those dear little girls of yours have put me
to shame with their lively, earnest desire to
do good to others. Here have I been leading
this lazy, useless life ever since I came home,
looking only to my own comfort and happiness;
and in my want of thought for others
scarcely deserving the overflowing share of
both which has fallen to me. Your little
ones have given me a lesson in their innocent
wish to extend to others the benefits which
God has heaped upon them; now cannot you
help me to put it into practice? I am still
so much of a stranger in my own city that I
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
should scarcely know where to begin the task
of carrying help to those who need it; but
you were always a hand to know the claims
and deserts of the poor. I have, thank God,
the means and the time; can you show me
where I can best spend them?"</p>

<p>"Doubtless, my dear fellow," answered Mr.
Bradford. "I think you are rather hard upon
yourself; but I can show you where both
time and money can be laid out with a
certainty of doing good and bringing happiness
to those who deserve them. Just now&mdash;But
how far do your benevolent intentions
go?"</p>

<p>"Tell me the necessities of your <i>protegée</i>
or <i>protegées</i>," said Mr. Stanton, smiling,
"and I will tell you how far I am inclined
to satisfy them. I had not thought much
about it, having just been roused to a sense
that it was time I was doing somewhat for
the welfare of those who are not as well off
as myself."</p>

<p>"I was about to say," continued Mr. Bradford,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
"that at present I know of no more
worthy case than that of the father of the
blind boy in whom my children are so much
interested. If an honest, God-fearing heart,
a trusting, cheerful, yet submissive spirit, can
give him a claim upon our help and sympathy,
he certainly possesses it. I have watched him
and talked to him during the last few months
with considerable interest, and I honestly believe
his troubles have not arisen through any
fault of his own, but through the dealings of
Providence. He has been sorely tried, poor
fellow, and I should like to see him set right
once more with the world, free from the pressure
of debt, and able to save his earnings for
the comfort of his family. I had intended to
undertake the payment of Dr. Dawson for the
treatment of Willie's eyes, but since you have
done this, I shall hand to Richards the sum
I had intended for that purpose. Whatever
you may choose to add to this, will be so
much towards relieving him from his debt to
this Schwitz."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>"And how much is that?" asked Mr.
Stanton.</p>

<p>Mr. Bradford named the sum, and after
hearing all the circumstances, Mr. Stanton
drew a check for the amount needed to pay
the rest of the debt to Dr. Schwitz, and gave
it to his brother-in-law, asking him to hand
it to the policeman with his own gift.</p>

<p>"You had better come with us this afternoon,
and see for yourself," said Mr. Bradford.
"It is going to be fine, and I have
promised those dear little things that they
shall carry their prize to the blind boy's home.
I believe we are likely to find Richards there
about three o'clock, and I should like you to
know him."</p>

<p>So Mr. Stanton was persuaded; and as
Maggie and Bessie were watching eagerly
from the window for the first glimpse of papa,
they saw him coming up the street with
Uncle Ruthven.</p>

<p>When they were ready to go, those three
precious notes, the price of Willie's sight,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
were brought by Maggie to her father, with
many prayers that he would take the best of
care of them. She was not satisfied till she
had seen them in his pocket-book, where she
herself squeezed them into the smallest possible
corner, next thrusting the pocket-book
into the very depths of his pockets, and ramming
in his handkerchief on top of that, "to
be sure to keep it all safe."</p>

<p>But there was a sore disappointment in
store for these poor children. As they were
leaving the house, and before Mr. Bradford
had closed the door behind them, who should
appear at the foot of the steps but Sergeant
Richards himself, with his broad, honest face
in a glow of happiness and content.</p>

<p>"Ah! Richards, how are you?" said Mr.
Bradford.</p>

<p>"At your service, sir," answered the policeman,
politely touching his cap. "I just came
round to say a word to you, but I see you are
going out. I sha'n't detain you two moments,
though, if you could spare me that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>"Willingly," said Mr. Bradford. "We
were on our way to your house, but our
errand will keep;" and he led the way back
to the parlor, followed by the whole party.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bradford and Miss Rush were there
also, just ready to go out; while Aunt Patty
sat in the library, where every word that
passed in the front room must reach her ears.</p>

<p>"No, I'll not sit down, thank you, sir,"
said the policeman, "and I'll not keep you
long. You have been so kind to me, and
taken such an interest in all my difficulties,
that I felt as if I must come right up and tell
you of the good fortune, or, I should say, the
kind Providence, which has fallen to me. I
have been furnished with the means to pay
my debt to Dr. Schwitz; and more, thank
God! more than this, Dr. Dawson has received
the amount of his charge for the operation
on Willie's eyes. I shall be able to hold
up my head once more, and that with the
chance of my boy having his sight again."</p>

<p>"And how has this come about?" asked
Mr. Bradford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>"I cannot say, sir. Some unknown friend
has done it all; but who, I know no more
than yourself, perhaps not so much;" and the
policeman looked searchingly into Mr. Bradford's
face.</p>

<p>"And I know absolutely nothing," said the
gentleman, smiling. "I see, Richards, you
thought I had some hand in it, and expected
to find me out; but I assure you, it is not
my doing. These little girls of mine had,
through the kindness of their uncle, hoped to
place in your hands the sum needed for Dr.
Dawson, and it was for this purpose that we
were on our way to your house; but you say
some one has been beforehand with us."</p>

<p>"That's so, sir," said Richards; "but none
the less am I most grateful to you and the
little ladies and this kind gentleman for your
generous intentions. I am sure I don't know
what I have done that the Lord should raise
me up such friends. But it is most strange
as to who could have done this, sir, and about
that old lady."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>"What old lady?" asked Mr. Bradford.</p>

<p>"Why, sir, she who either has done this or
has been sent by some one else. If I don't
keep you too long, I should just like to tell
you what I know."</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Mr. Bradford. "Let us
have the story."</p>

<p>"Yesterday morning," said the policeman,
"Mrs. Granby was sitting by the window,
when she saw an old lady going to 'most all
the houses, and seeming to be asking her way
or inquiring for some one. So Mrs. Granby
puts out her head and asks if she was looking
for any one. 'I want Mrs. Richards, the
policeman's wife,' says the old lady. Mrs.
Granby told her that was the place and opens
the door for her. Well, she walked in, but a
stranger she was, to be sure; neither my wife
nor Mrs. Granby ever set eyes on her before,
and they did not know what to make of her.
All sorts of questions she asked, and in a way
Mary did not like at all, never telling who she
was or what she came for. Well, after a
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
while she went away, but never letting on
what she had come for, and Mrs. Granby and
Mary set it down that it was only for spying
and meddling. But last night when I took
up the Bible to read a chapter before we went
to bed, out drops a sealed packet with my
name printed on it. I opened it, and there,
will you believe it, sir, were two one hundred
dollar bills, and around them a slip of paper
with the words, printed, too, 'Pay your debts.'
No more, no less. You may know if we were
astonished, and as for my wife, she was even
a bit frightened. After talking it over, we
were sure it could have been no one but the
old lady that had put it there. But who was
she, and how did she know so much of my affairs?
Mrs. Granby said she remembered to
have seen her fussing with the leaves of the
Bible, sort of careless like, as it lay upon the
table, and she must have slipped it in then.
But whether it was her own gift, or whether
she was sent by some one else, who does not
care to be seen in the matter, I don't know.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
The women will have it that it was the last,
and that she did not like her errand, and so
eased her mind by a bit of fault-finding and
meddling, and I must say it looks like it."</p>

<p>"And you have no possible clew to who
this person was, Richards?" asked Mr. Bradford.</p>

<p>"None, sir. I might track her easy, I suppose,
but since she didn't seem to wish it to
be known who she was or where she came
from, I wouldn't feel it was showing my gratitude
for the obligations she's laid me under,
and you see by the printing she don't wish
to be tracked even by her handwriting. Nor
was this all. Early this morning, round
comes Dr. Dawson to the station, asking for
me; and he told me that an old lady had
been to his house yesterday, and after asking
a lot of questions, had paid him a hundred and
fifty dollars for undertaking the operation on
Willie's eyes, and took a receipted bill from
him. By all accounts, she must be the same
person who was at my place yesterday, and if
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
ever a man was as mad as a hornet, he's the
one. When he asked if he might take the liberty
of inquiring what interest she had in my
family, she asked if it was necessary to Willie's
cure that he should know that; and when he
said, 'No, of course not,' she said it <i>was</i> a
great liberty, and as good as told him to mind
his own affairs. He quite agrees with my
wife and Mrs. Granby that she was only a
messenger from some unknown friend, and
that she was not pleased with the business she
had in hand. The doctor is very much occupied
just now, and told her he could not well
see me before this evening; but he found he
could make time to run over and tell me this
morning, and kindly did so. So, you see, sir,
I do not rightly know what to do, joyful and
grateful as I feel; and I thought I would just
run over and tell you the story at once, and
ask if you thought I might safely use this
money without fear of getting into any difficulty.
You see it's such a strange and
mysterious way of doing things that I won't
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
say but I would think it odd myself if I heard
another person had come by such a sum in
such a way."</p>

<p>"I see no possible objection to your using
the money," said Mr. Bradford. "It certainly
has been intended for you, however singular
the way in which it has been conveyed to
you, or however disagreeable the manner of
the messenger. It has probably been the
work of some eccentric, but kind-hearted person
who does not choose to have his good
deeds known."</p>

<p>"I can't say but I would feel better to
know whom it came from, Mr. Bradford, grateful
from my very soul as I am. I shouldn't
have been too proud to take such a favor
from one who I knew was a friend to me,
with the hope, maybe, of one day making it
up, but it's not so comfortable to have it
done in this secret sort of way, and as if it
were something to be ashamed of."</p>

<p>"Do not look at it in that way, Richards,
but believe that your friend has only acted
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
thus from a wish that his left hand should
not know what his right hand has done.
Look at it as a gift from the Lord, and use
it with an easy heart and a clear conscience,
as I am sure your benefactor intended."</p>

<p>"Well, may God bless and prosper him,
whoever he is," said the policeman. "I only
wish he knew what a load is lifted from my
heart. And thank you too, sir, for your advice
and for all your interest in me."</p>

<p>While the policeman had been telling his
story, Maggie and Bessie had stood listening
eagerly to him. At first they looked pleased
as well as interested, but when it was made
plain to them that some stranger had done
the very thing on which they had set their
hearts, a look of blank dismay and disappointment
overspread their faces. By the time he
had finished, Bessie, with her head pressed
against her mother's shoulder, was choking
back the tears, and Maggie, with crimson
cheeks and wide-open eyes, was standing, the
very picture of indignation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>"Papa," she exclaimed, as Mr. Richards
said the last words, "does he really mean
that woman went and paid that money for
blind Willie to be cured?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my darling," said her father, with a
feeling of real pity for the disappointment of
his two little daughters, "but I think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's too bad," said Maggie, without waiting
for her father to finish his sentence;
"it's as mean, as mean as&mdash;Oh! I never
heard of anything so mean; the horrid old
thing! something ought to be done to her.
I know she just did it to make a disappointment
to Bessie and me. Oh, dear! It's
too bad!" She finished with a burst of tears.</p>

<p>"My dear little girl," said her father, "I
know this is a great disappointment to you;
but you must not let it make you unreasonable.
This person is probably an entire stranger to
you; and any way, she could know nothing of
your purpose."</p>

<p>"You will find plenty of uses for the
money," said Uncle Ruthven, catching Bessie
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
up in his arms. "Put it away till you find
another blind boy, or lame girl, or some old
sick body, who would be glad of a little help.
Papa will find you ways enough to spend it."</p>

<p>"But," said Bessie, mournfully, as she
wiped her eyes, "we wanted to use it for
Willie, and we thought so much about it,
and we were so glad when we thought how
pleased he would be! Oh! we are very much
<i>trialed</i>; are we not, Maggie?"</p>

<p>"Now the Lord love you for your thought
of my boy," said the policeman, "and I'm
sure I wish, for your sake, that the old lady
had stopped short of Dr. Dawson's door, keeping
her money for some other folks that had
need of it, and leaving it to you two dear
little ones to do this kind turn for my child.
But Willie will think just as much, as I do, of
your meaning to do it, as if you'd done it
out and out; and if you'll allow it, madam,"&mdash;here
he turned to Mrs. Bradford, "I'd like
to bring him over, that he may say so."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bradford said she would be very glad
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
to see Willie, and asked Mr. Richards to
bring him and Jennie over the next day, and
let them spend an hour or two with the children.
This she did, thinking it would be a
pleasure to her little girls to see the blind
boy and his sister, and wishing to do all she
could to console them for their disappointment.</p>

<p class="pmb3">The policeman promised to do this, and
then, once more thanking Mr. Bradford and
his family for all their kindness, he went
away.</p>

</span>
ut Maggie and Bessie, especially the
former, were quite determined not to
be consoled. They thought such a
terrible disappointment deserved to be sorrowed
over for some time to come, and sat
with tearful faces and a very mournful manner,
quite unable to do anything but grieve.</p>

<p>"I hope I shall have strength to bear it, but
I don't know," said Maggie, with her pocket-handkerchief
to her eyes.</p>

<p>Mamma told her that the way to bear a trial
was not to sit fretting over it and thinking
how bad it was, but to look at its bright side,
and see what good we or others might gain
from it.</p>

<p>"But <i>this</i> has no bright side; has it, mamma?"
asked Bessie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think so," replied her mother. "This
unknown friend has done much more for the
policeman and his family than you could have
done, and she has not only given the money
for Dr. Dawson, but has, also, paid the debt
to Dr. Schwitz; while your uncle is kind
enough to allow you to keep your money for
some one else who may need it."</p>

<p>"But, mamma," said Maggie, with her
eyes still covered, "Uncle Ruthven was going
to pay the debt himself; papa told us so. So
it would have been just as good for the policeman."</p>

<p>"I declare," said Mr. Stanton, "I had
quite forgotten that I was disappointed too!
Well, well;" and he leaned his head on his
hand, and put on a very doleful air. "Bradford,"
he continued, in the most mournful
tones, "since we are not to go over to the
policeman's this afternoon, I had thought we
might have some other little frolic; but of
course, none of us are in spirits for the visit
to the menagerie I had intended to propose."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>At this, Maggie's handkerchief came down,
and Bessie raised her head from her mother's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"I do not know but I might go, if I could
make up a pleasant, happy party to take with
me," said Mr. Stanton. "<i>You</i> could not
think of it, I suppose, Maggie?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Maggie, half unwilling
to be so soon comforted, and yet too much
pleased at the thought of this unexpected
treat to be able to refuse it. "Perhaps I
might. I think maybe it would do me good
to see the animals." But she still sat with the
air of a little martyr, hoping that Uncle Ruthven
would press her very much, so that she
might not seem to yield too easily.</p>

<p>"I thought perhaps it might bring <i>me</i> a little
comfort to see the monkeys eat peanuts,
and then make faces at me, while they pelted
me with the shells," said Mr. Stanton, in the
same despairing tone.</p>

<p>At this Bessie broke into a little low laugh,
and the dimples showed themselves at the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
corners of Maggie's mouth, though she pursed
up her lips, and drew down her eyebrows in
her determination not to smile. But it was
all useless, and in two moments more Uncle
Ruthven had them both as merry as crickets
over this new pleasure. Mamma and Aunt
Bessie were coaxed to give up their shopping
and go with them, and the three boys, Harry,
Fred, and Franky, being added to the party,
they all set off in good spirits.</p>

<p>The blind boy and the terrible disappointment
were not forgotten, but the children had
made up their minds to take mamma's advice,&mdash;bear
it bravely, and look on the bright side.</p>

<p>Aunt Patty saw them go, and was glad to
be left to herself, although her own thoughts
were not very pleasant company. She had
done a kind and generous action in an ungracious
way, causing those whom she had
benefited to feel that they would rather have
received the favor from another hand, bringing
a real trial upon these dear children, and
vexation and regret to herself. She could not
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
look upon her work or its consequences with
any satisfaction. What though she had done
a good deed, she had not done it quite in the
right spirit, and so it seemed it had not
brought a blessing. Self-will and temper had
been suffered to overcome her once more.
Bessie had shamed her by the self-control which
she, an old woman, had not shown, and she
had been outdone by both these little ones in
patience and submission. The policeman's
family would have been quite as well off as
they were now, and she might still have had
the long-desired grove, the object of so many
thoughts and wishes, had she never taken up
the matter, or had she even allowed her intentions
to be known. She had really had an honest
desire to keep her generous self-sacrifice a
secret, that it should not be published abroad
to all the world; but there was, also, an obstinate
little corner in her heart which made her
determine to keep it from her nephew, lest he
should oppose it. "For I want none of his
advice or interference," she said, to herself;
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
it being generally the case that those who
deal most largely in those articles themselves
are the most unwilling to receive them from
others.</p>

<p>So the poor old lady sadly thought, taking
shame and repentance to herself for all the
peevishness and ill-temper of the last two
days, seeing where she had acted wrongly and
unwisely, and making new resolutions for the
future. Ah, the old besetting sin, strengthened
by long habit and indulgence, what a
tyrant it had become, and how hard she had
to struggle with it, how often was she overcome!
Yes, well might little Bessie be thankful
that wise and tender teachers had taught
her to control that passionate temper, which
later might have proved such a misery to
herself and her friends. Then came back to
her the dear child's trusting words, "Jesus
knows," bringing with them a comforting sense
of his near love and presence, and a feeling
that his help and forgiveness were still open to
her, though she had again so sadly given way.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
Oh, that she had little Bessie's simple faith!
that this feeling of the Saviour's nearness, this
constant looking to him for help and guidance,
which were shown by this little one,
were hers also! She bethought herself of a
hymn, which she had heard Mrs. Bradford
teaching to her children during the last week,
and which they had all sung together on Sunday
evening. She could not recollect the
exact words, but it seemed to her that it was
the very thing she needed now. She searched
for it through all the hymn-books and tune-books
on which she could lay her hands, but
in vain; and, as was Aunt Patty's way, the
more she could not find it, the more she
seemed to want it. Should she ask the children
for it when they came home? To do
so, would be the same as confessing that she
had done wrong, and that was the hardest
thing in the world for the proud old lady to
do. But yes, she would do it! Nay, more,
she would no longer be outdone by a little
child in generosity and humility. She would
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
tell the children that she was sorry for her
unkindness of the morning.</p>

<p>It did Aunt Patty no harm, but a great
deal of good, that long afternoon's musing in
the silent house, where no patter of children's
feet, nor any sound of young voices was
heard; for baby had gone to her grandmamma,
so that even her soft coo and joyous
crow were missing for some hours.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the children were enjoying themselves
amazingly; for a visit to the menagerie
with Uncle Ruthven, who knew so much of
the wild beasts and their habits, and who told
of them in such an interesting way, was no
common treat. The day had been as April-like
within as without, clouds and sunshine
by turns, ending at last in settled brightness;
and no one who had seen the happy faces of
our Maggie and Bessie would have thought
that they could have worn such woeful looks
but a few hours since.</p>

<p>After reaching home, they were passing
through the upper hall on their way down to
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
the parlor, where they had left papa and Uncle
Ruthven, when Aunt Patty's door opened, and
she called them. They stood still and hesitated.</p>

<p>"Come in," said Mrs. Lawrence again, in
a gentle tone; "Aunt Patty wants to speak to
you."</p>

<p>Maggie and Bessie obeyed, but slowly and
unwillingly, as the old lady grieved to see,
the former with drooping head and downcast
eyes, while Bessie peeped shyly up at her aunt
from under her eyelashes.</p>

<p>"Aunt Patty was cross, and vexed you this
morning," said Mrs. Lawrence; "but she is
sorry now. Come, kiss her and be friends."</p>

<p>In a moment Bessie's rosebud of a mouth
was put up for the desired kiss, but Maggie
still held back. It was not that she was unforgiving,
but this meekness from Aunt Patty
was something so new, and so contrary to all
the ideas she had formed of her, that she did
not know how to believe in it, or to understand
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p>"Kiss her," whispered Bessie; "it is not
'bearing her burden' if you don't."</p>

<p>So Maggie's face was lifted also, and as her
aunt bent down and kissed her, she was astonished
to see how gentle and kind, although
sad, she looked. The "corners" were all out
of sight just now, and Maggie even began to
feel sorry that she had wished Aunt Patty to
be "a pillar of salt which might be soaked
away in the rain."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lawrence asked them if they had enjoyed
themselves, and put a question or two
about the menagerie in a pleasant, gentle tone,
which showed that her ill-temper was all gone.
Then there was a moment's silence, the children
wishing, yet not exactly knowing how, to
run away; at the end of which, Mrs. Lawrence
said, in rather an embarrassed voice, as
if she were half ashamed of what she was doing,
"Bessie, where did you find that little
hymn, 'Listen, oh, listen, our Father all
holy'?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it is in our dear little 'Chapel
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
Gems,'" said the child. "Is it not pretty,
Aunt Patty? Mamma found it, and I asked
her to teach it to us, 'cause it was so sweet
to say when any of us had been naughty.
When we sing it, I think it's just like a little
prayer in music."</p>

<p>"Can you find the book for me?" asked
the old lady.</p>

<p>"Mamma lent it to Mrs. Rush. She wanted
to have the music, so we might have it for one
of our Sunday-school hymns. I'll ask mamma
to let you have it as soon as Aunt May sends
it back."</p>

<p>"It is of no consequence," said Mrs. Lawrence,
in a tone in which Bessie fancied there
was some disappointment. "Do not let me
keep you if you want to go."</p>

<p>Both children turned toward the door, but
before they reached it, Bessie lingered, also detaining
Maggie, who held her hand.</p>

<p>"Aunt Patty," she said, sweetly, "I think
it is of consequence if you want it. And&mdash;and&mdash;I
know 'Our Father all holy.' If you
would like, I can say it to you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb1">"Come, then, darling," answered the old
lady, and standing at her knee with Aunt
Patty's hand resting on her curls, Bessie
repeated, slowly and correctly, this beautiful
hymn:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Listen, oh, listen, our Father all holy!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Humble and sorrowful, owning my sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hear me confess, in my penitence lowly,<br /></span>

</div></div>
<p class="pmb1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p>"'I had not sinned, had I felt thou wert
nigh,'" she said again, after she was through
with the last line. "I wish we could always
remember our Father is nigh; don't you,
Aunt Patty? We know it, but sometimes we
forget it a little, and then the naughtiness
comes, and so we grieve him. But is not that
a sweet hymn to say when we are sorry for
our sin, and want him to help and forgive us
again? I felt it was yesterday when I had
been angry and spoken so naughty to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, child, child!" was all the answer
Mrs. Lawrence gave. Her heart had been
softened before, now it was quite melted, and
putting her arm about Bessie, she drew her to
her and kissed her on both cheeks; while
Maggie stood by wondering as she heard the
tremor of Aunt Patty's voice and saw something
very like a tear in her eye.</p>

<p>"Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings,
Thou hast perfected praise," murmured the
old lady to herself, when the door had closed
behind the children. "Lord, make me even
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
like unto this little child, granting me such
faith, such grace, such patience, such an earnest
desire to do thy will, to live only to thy
glory."</p>

<p>Yes, such were the lessons learned even by
an old woman like Aunt Patty from this little
lamb of Jesus, this little follower of her blessed
Lord and Master. "Even a child is known by
his doings."</p>

<p>"Who is for a summer among the mountains?"
asked Mr. Bradford as the family sat
around the table after dinner.</p>

<p>"I am, and I, and I!" came from a chorus
of young voices, for from papa's look it was
plainly to be seen that the question was addressed
to the children, and that the grown
people had had their say before. Even baby,
who was learning to imitate everything, made
a sound which might be interpreted into an
"I;" but one little voice was silent.</p>

<p>"And has my Bessie nothing to say?"
asked papa.</p>

<p>"Is the sea at the mountains, papa?" said
Bessie, answering his question by another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, dear," said her father, smiling, "but
among the mountains to which we think of
going, there is a very beautiful lake, on the
border of which stands the house in which
we shall stay."</p>

<p>"I am very fond of the sea, papa," answered
Bessie, "and I think I would prefer
to go to Quam Beach again,&mdash;I mean if the
others liked it too."</p>

<p>"I do not doubt we should all enjoy ourselves
at Quam," said Mr. Bradford, "for we
spent a very pleasant summer there last year.
But grandmamma does not think the sea-side
good for Aunt Annie's throat, and wishes to
take her up among the mountains. The colonel's
doctor has also advised him to go there,
so we shall not have the same delightful party
we had last summer if we go to Quam.
About four miles from the old homestead,
and higher up in the Chalecoo Mountains, is
this very lovely lake set deep among the rocks
and woods. Here lives a man named Porter,&mdash;you
remember him, Aunt Patty?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly," answered Mrs. Lawrence,
"he has been adding to and refitting his
house, with the intention of taking boarders, I
believe. Do you think of going there?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I remember even in former days it
was an airy, comfortable old place, and with
the improvements which I hear Porter has
made, I think it will just suit our party.
What do you say, Bessie? Would you not
like to go there with all the dear friends,
rather than to Quam without them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Bessie; "I like my people
better than I do the sea; but then I do wish
there was just a little bit of sea there, papa."</p>

<p>Papa smiled at Bessie's regret for the grand
old ocean, which she loved so dearly; but as
he told her of the many new pleasures she
might find among the mountains, she began
to think they might prove almost as delightful
as those of the last summer at Quam Beach.</p>

<p>So the plan was talked over with pleasure
by all. Papa and Uncle Ruthven were to
start the next morning to go up to the lake,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
see the house, and, if it suited, to make all the
necessary arrangements. The party was a
large one to be accommodated,&mdash;grandmamma
and Aunt Annie, Uncle Ruthven and
Aunt Bessie, Colonel and Mrs. Rush, and Mr.
and Mrs. Bradford with all their family;
and as soon as it was found to be doubtful
if this could be done, all the children, even
Bessie, were in a flutter of anxiety lest they
should be disappointed. This was of no use,
however, for the matter could not be decided
till papa and Uncle Ruthven returned.</p>

<p>"I have a little private business with Maggie
and Bessie," said papa, as they rose from
the table. "Young ladies, may I request the
honor of your company in my room for a
few moments?"</p>

<p>Wondering what could be coming now, but
sure from papa's face that it was something
very pleasant, the little girls went skipping
and dancing before him to the library, where,
sitting down, papa lifted Bessie to his knee,
and Maggie upon the arm of the chair, holding
her there with his arm about her waist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>When they were all settled, Mr. Bradford
said, "Uncle Ruthven and I have a plan
which we thought might please you, but if
you do not like it, you are to say so."</p>

<p>"Papa," said Maggie, "if it's any plan about
that money, I think we'll have to consider
it a little first. You see it seems to us as
if it was very much Willie's money, and we
will have to be a little accustomed to think
it must do good to some one else."</p>

<p>This was said with a very grave, businesslike
air, which sat rather drolly upon our
merry, careless Maggie, and her father smiled.</p>

<p>"I shall tell you," he said, "and then you
may have the next two days, till Uncle Ruthven
and I come back, to consider it. Dr. Dawson
thinks it necessary for Willie Richards to
have change of air as soon as he is able to
travel. Of course his mother must go with
him, to take care of him; and, indeed, it is
needful for the poor woman herself to have
mountain air. I have thought that we might
find some quiet farmhouse at or near Chalecoo,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
where Willie and his mother could go
for two or three months at a small cost; but I
do not believe it is possible for the policeman to
afford even this, without very great discomfort
and even suffering to himself and his family.
Now, how would you like to use the money
Uncle Ruthven gave you to pay the board
of Willie and his mother, and so still spend
it for his good and comfort? As I said, you
may take two days to think over this plan,
and if it does not suit you, you can say so."</p>

<p>Ah! this was quite unnecessary, as papa
probably knew. <i>This</i> needed no consideration.
Why, it was almost as good as paying
Dr. Dawson,&mdash;rather better, Maggie thought.</p>

<p>But Bessie could not quite agree to this last.
"I am very satisfied, papa," she said, "but
then it would have been so nice to think our
money helped to make blind Willie see his
mother's face."</p>

<p>"Maggie, have you forgiven that old woman
yet?" asked Fred, when his father and
little sisters had joined the rest of the family
in the other room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" said Maggie. "I think she is
lovely! She has made things a great deal better
for us, though she did not know it, and
blind Willie is to go to the country. But you
are not to talk about it, Fred, for he is not to
be told till it is all fixed, and papa has found
the place; and we are to pay the board, and I'm
so sorry I said bad things about her, even if
she was only the messenger, and some one
sent her."</p>

<p>"Hallo!" said Fred, "anything more?"</p>

<p class="pmb3">"I am so full of gladness, I don't know
what to do with it," said Maggie, who very
often found herself in this state; "but I am so
very tired I can't hop much to-night."</p>

</span>
here," said Mrs. Granby, holding
Willie Richards at arm's length from
her, and gazing at him with pride and
admiration,&mdash;"there, I'd like to see the fellow,
be he man, woman, or child, that will dare to
say my boy is not fit to stand beside any
gentleman's son in the land."</p>

<p>Certainly Mrs. Granby had no need to be
ashamed of the object of her affectionate care.
His shoes, though well worn and patched, had
been blacked and polished till they looked
quite respectable; the suit made from his
father's old uniform was still neat and whole,
for Willie's present quiet life was a great
saving to his clothes, if that were any comfort;
his white collar was turned back and neatly
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
tied with a black ribbon, and Mrs. Granby had
just combed back the straight locks from his
pale, fair forehead in a jaunty fashion which
she thought highly becoming to him. There
was a look of hope and peace on his delicate
face which and not been there for many a long
day, for last night his father had told him that
the doctor had an almost sure hope of restoring
his sight, if he were good and patient, and
that the operation was to take place the next
week. The news had put fresh heart and life
into the poor boy, and now, as Mrs. Granby
said this, he laughed aloud, and throwing both
arms about her neck, and pressing his cheek
to hers, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thank you, dear Auntie Granby. I know
I am nice when you fix me up. Pretty soon
I shall <i>see</i> how nice you make me look."</p>

<p>"Come now, Jennie, bring along that mop
of yours," said Mrs. Granby, brandishing a
comb at Jennie, and, half laughing, half
shrinking, the little girl submitted to put her
head into Mrs. Granby's hands. But, as had
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
been the case very often before, it was soon
given up as a hopeless task. Jennie's short,
crisp curls defied both comb and brush, and
would twist themselves into close, round rings,
lying one over another after their own will and
fashion.</p>

<p>"I don't care," said Jennie, when Mrs.
Granby pretended to be very angry at the rebellious
hair,&mdash;"I don't care if it won't be
smoothed; it is just like father's, mother says
so; and anything like him is good enough for
me."</p>

<p>"Well, I won't say no to that," said Mrs.
Granby, putting down the brush and throwing
Jennie's dress over her head. "The more
you're like him in all ways, the better you'll
be, Jennie Richards, you mind that."</p>

<p>"I do mind it," said Jennie. "I know
he's the best father ever lived. Isn't he,
Willie?"</p>

<p>"S'pose that's what all young ones says
of their fathers and mothers," answered Mrs.
Granby, "even s'posin' the fathers and mothers
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
ain't much to boast of. But you're nearer the
truth, Jennie, than some of them, and it's all
right and nat'ral that every child should think
its own folks the best. There's little Miss
Bradfords, what you're goin' up to see, they'd
be ready to say the same about their pa."</p>

<p>"And good reason, too," chimed in Mrs.
Richards. "He's as true and noble a gentleman
as ever walked, and a good friend to us."</p>

<p>"That's so," answered Mrs. Granby, "I'll
not gainsay you there neither. And that's
come all along of your man just speaking a
kind word or two to that stray lamb of his.
And if I'd a mind to contradick you, which
I haint, there's Sergeant Richards himself to
back your words. The bairns is 'most ready,
sergeant; and me and Mary was just sayin' how
strange it seemed that such a friend as Mr.
Bradford was raised up for you just along of a
bit of pettin' you give that lost child. It's as
the gentleman says,&mdash;'bread cast upon the
waters;' but who'd ha' thought to see it come
back the way it does? It beats all how things
do come around."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<p>"Under God's guidance," said the policeman,
softly. "The Lord's ways are past finding
out."</p>

<p>"I'll agree to that too," answered Mrs.
Granby, "bein' in an accommodatin' humor
this afternoon. There, now, Jennie, you're
ready. Mind your manners now, and behave
pretty, and don't let Willie go to falling down
them long stairs at Mrs. Bradford's. There,
kiss your mother, both of you, and go away
with your father. I s'pose he ain't got no time
to spare. I'll go over after them in an hour
or so, Sergeant Richards."</p>

<p>Here Tommy began very eagerly with his
confused jargon which no one pretended to
understand but Jennie.</p>

<p>"What does he say, Jennie?" asked the
father.</p>

<p>"He says, 'Nice little girl, come some
more. Bring her doggie,'" said Jennie; then
turning to her mother, she asked, "Mother,
do you b'lieve you can understand Tommy till
I come back?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll try," said her mother, smiling; "if I
cannot, Tommy and I must be patient. Run
now, father is waiting."</p>

<p>Mrs. Granby followed them to the door,
and even to the gate, where she stood and
watched them till they were out of sight, for,
as she told Mrs. Richards, "it did her a heap
of good to see the poor things goin' off for a
bit of a holiday."</p>

<p>The policeman and his children kept steadily
on till they reached the park near which
Mr. Bradford lived, where they turned in.</p>

<p>"How nice it is!" said Willie as the fresh,
sweet air blew across his face, bringing the
scent of the new grass and budding trees.
"It seems a little like the country here.
Don't you wish we lived in the country,
father?"</p>

<p>"I would like it, Willie, more for your sake
than for anything else, and I wish from my
heart I could send you and mother off to the
country this summer, my boy. But you see
it can't be managed. But I guess somehow
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
father will contrive to send you now and then
up to Central Park, or for a sail down the bay
or up the river. And you and Jennie can
come over here every day and play about
awhile, and that will put a bit of strength in
you, if you can't get out into the country."</p>

<p>"And then I shall see; sha'n't I, father?
I hear the birds. Are they hopping about like
they used to, over the trees, so tame and
nice?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered his father, "and here we
are by the water, where's a whole heap of 'em
come down for a drink." In his new hope,
Willie took a fresh interest in all about him.</p>

<p>"Oh, I hear 'em!" said Willie, eagerly,
"and soon I'll see 'em. Will it be next week,
father?" and he clasped tightly the hand he
held.</p>

<p>"I don't know about next week, sonny. I
believe your eyes have to be bandaged for a
while, lest the light would be too bright for
them, while they're still weak, but you will
have patience for that; won't you, Willie?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p>Willie promised, for it seemed to him that
he could have patience and courage for anything
now.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Jennie, as they reached Mr.
Bradford's house, and went up the steps,
"don't I wish I lived in a house like this!"</p>

<p>"Don't be wishing that," said her father.
"You'll see a good many things here such as
you never saw before, but you mustn't go to
wishing for them or fretting after the same.
We've too much to be thankful for, my lassie,
to be hankering for things which are not likely
ever to be ours."</p>

<p>"'Tis no harm to wish for them; is it, father?"
asked Jennie, as they waited for the
door to be opened.</p>

<p>"It's not best even to wish for what's beyond
our reach," said her father, "lest we
should get to covet our neighbors' goods, or to
be discontented with our own lot; and certainly
we have no call to do that."</p>

<p>Richards asked for Mrs. Bradford, and she
presently came down, bringing Maggie and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
Bessie with her. Jennie felt a little strange
and frightened at first when her father left
her. Making acquaintance with Maggie and
Bessie in her own home was a different
thing from coming to visit them in their large,
handsome house, and they scarcely seemed to
her like the same little girls. But when Maggie
took her up-stairs, and showed her the
baby-house and dolls, she forgot everything
else, and looked at them, quite lost in admiration.</p>

<p>Willie was not asked to look at anything.
The little sisters had thought of what he had
said the day they went to see him, and agreed
that Bessie was to take care of him while Maggie
entertained Jennie. He asked after Flossy,
and the dog was called, and behaved quite as
well as he had done when he saw Willie before,
lying quiet in his arms as long as the blind boy
chose to hold him, and putting his cold nose
against his face in an affectionate way which
delighted Willie highly.</p>

<p>There was no difficulty in amusing Jennie,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
who had eyes for all that was to be seen, and
who thought she could never be tired of handling
and looking at such beautiful toys and
books. But perhaps the children would hardly
have known how to entertain Willie for any
length of time, if a new pleasure had not
accidentally been furnished for him.</p>

<p>Maggie and Bessie had just taken him and
his sister into the nursery to visit the baby,
the canary bird, and other wonders there, when
there came sweet sounds from below. Willie
instantly turned to the door and stood listening.</p>

<p>"Who's making that music?" he asked
presently in a whisper, as if he were afraid to
lose a note.</p>

<p>"Mamma and Aunt Bessie," said Maggie.</p>

<p>"Would you and Jennie like to go down to
the parlor and hear it?" asked Bessie.</p>

<p>Willie said "Yes," very eagerly, but Jennie
did not care to go where the grown ladies
were, and said she would rather stay up-stairs
if Maggie did not mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p>Maggie consented, and Bessie went off,
leading the blind boy by the hand. It was
both amusing and touching to see the watch
she kept over this child who was twice her
own size, guiding his steps with a motherly
sort of care, looking up at him with wistful
pity and tenderness, and speaking to him in a
soft, coaxing voice such as one would use to
an infant.</p>

<p>They were going down-stairs when they met
Aunt Patty coming up. She passed them at
the landing, then suddenly turning, said, in
the short, quick way to which Bessie was by
this time somewhat accustomed, "Children!
Bessie! This is very dangerous! You should
not be leading that poor boy down-stairs.
Where are your nurses, that they do not
see after you? Take care, take care! Look
where you are going now! Carefully, carefully!"</p>

<p>Now if Aunt Patty had considered the
matter, she would have known she was taking
the very way to bring about the thing she
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
dreaded. Willie had been going on fearlessly,
listening to his gentle little guide; but at the
sound of the lady's voice he started, and as
she kept repeating her cautions, he grew
nervous and uneasy; while Bessie, instead of
watching his steps and taking heed to her own,
kept glancing up at her aunt with an uncomfortable
sense of being watched by those sharp
eyes.</p>

<p>However, they both reached the lower hall
in safety, where Bessie led her charge to the
parlor-door. "Mamma," she said, "Willie
likes music very much. I suppose you would
just as lief he would listen to you and Aunt
Bessie."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said mamma. "Bring him
in."</p>

<p>But before they went in, Willie paused and
turned to Bessie.</p>

<p>"Who was that on the stairs?" he asked in
a whisper.</p>

<p>"Oh! that was only Aunt Patty," answered
the little girl. "You need not be afraid of
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
her. She don't mean to be so cross as she is;
but she is old, and had a great deal of trouble,
and not very wise people to teach her better
when she was little. So she can't help it
sometimes."</p>

<p>"No," said Willie, slowly, as if he were
trying to recollect something, "I am not
afraid; but then I thought I had heard that
voice before."</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess not," said Bessie; and then
she took him in and seated him in her own
little arm-chair, close to the piano.</p>

<p>No one who had noticed the way in which
the blind boy listened to the music, or seen
the look of perfect enjoyment on his pale, patient
face, could have doubted his love for the
sweet sounds. While Mrs. Bradford and Miss
Rush played or sang, he sat motionless, not
moving a finger, hardly seeming to breathe,
lest he should lose one note.</p>

<p>"So you are very fond of music; are you,
Willie?" said Mrs. Bradford, when at length
they paused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, very," said he, modestly;
"but I never heard music like that before.
It seems 'most as if it was alive."</p>

<p>"So it does," said Bessie, while the ladies
smiled at the boy's innocent admiration.</p>

<p>"I think there's a many nice things in this
house," continued Willie, who, in his very
helplessness and unconsciousness of the many
new objects which surrounded him, was more
at his ease than his sister.</p>

<p>"And mamma is the nicest of all," said
Bessie. "You can't think how precious she
is, Willie!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Bradford laughed as she put back her
little daughter's curls, and kissed her forehead.</p>

<p>"I guess she must be, when she is your
mother," said Willie. "You must all be
very kind and good people here; and I wish,
oh, I wish it was you and your sister who
gave the money for Dr. Dawson. But never
mind; I thank you and love you all the same
as if you had done it, only I would like to
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
think it all came through you. And father
says"&mdash;</p>

<p>Here Willie started, and turned his sightless
eyes towards the open door, through
which was again heard Mrs. Lawrence's voice,
as she gave directions to Patrick respecting a
parcel she was about to send home.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Willie?" asked Mrs.
Bradford.</p>

<p>"Nothing, ma'am;" answered the child, as
a flush came into his pale cheeks, and rising
from his chair, he stood with his head bent
forward, listening intently, till the sound of
Aunt Patty's voice ceased, and the opening
and closing of the front-door showed that she
had gone out, when he sat down again with a
puzzled expression on his face.</p>

<p>"Does anything trouble you?" asked Mrs.
Bradford.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am; but&mdash;but&mdash;I <i>know</i> I've
heard it before."</p>

<p>"Heard what?"</p>

<p>"That voice, ma'am; Miss Bessie said it
was her aunt's."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you couldn't have heard it, you
know, Willie," said Bessie, "'cause you
never came to this house before, and Aunt
Patty never went to yours."</p>

<p>These last words brought it all back to the
blind boy. He knew now. "But she <i>did</i>,"
he said, eagerly,&mdash;"she did come to our
house. That's the one; that's the voice that
scolded mother and Auntie Granby and Jennie,
and that put the money into the Bible
when we didn't know it!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Bradford and Miss Rush looked at one
another with quick, surprised glances; but
Bessie said, "Oh! you must be mistaken,
Willie. It's quite <i>un</i>possible. Aunt Patty
does not know you or your house, and she
never went there. Besides, she does not"&mdash;"Does
not like you to have the money," she
was about to say, when she thought that this
would be neither kind nor polite, and checked
herself.</p>

<p>But Willie was quite as positive as she was,
and with a little shake of his head, he said,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
"Ever since I was blind, I always knew a
voice when I heard it once. I wish Jennie or
Mrs. Granby had seen her, they could tell
you; but I know that's the voice. It was
<i>you</i> sent her, after all, ma'am; was it not?"
and he turned his face toward Mrs. Bradford.</p>

<p>"No, Willie, I did not send her," answered
the lady, with another look at Miss
Rush, "nor did any one in this house."</p>

<p>But in spite of this, and all Bessie's persuasions
and assurances that the thing was quite
impossible, Willie was not to be convinced
that the voice he had twice heard was not
that of the old lady who had left the money
in the Bible; and he did not cease regretting
that Jennie had not seen her.</p>

<p>But to have Jennie or Mrs. Granby see her
was just what Mrs. Lawrence did not choose,
and to avoid this, she had gone out, not being
able to shut herself up in her own room,
which was undergoing a sweeping and dusting.
She had not been afraid of the sightless
eyes of the little boy when she met him on
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
the stairs, never thinking that he might recognize
her voice; but she had taken good care
not to meet those of Jennie, so quick and
bright, and which she felt would be sure to
know her in an instant. But secure as Aunt
Patty thought herself, when she was once out
of the house, that treacherous voice of hers
had betrayed her, not only to Willie's sensitive
ears, but to that very pair of eyes which
she thought she had escaped. For, as the
loud tones had reached Maggie and Jennie at
their play, the latter had dropped the toy she
held, and exclaimed, in a manner as startled
as Willie's, "There's that woman!"</p>

<p>"What woman?" asked Maggie.</p>

<p>"The old woman who brought the money
to our house. I know it is her."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, it is not," said Maggie; "that's
Aunt Patty, and she's an old lady, not an old
woman, and she wouldn't do it if she could.
She is real mean, Jennie, and I think that
person who took you the money was real good
and kind, even if we did feel a little bad about
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
it at first. Aunt Patty would never do it, I
know. Bessie and I try to like her, and just
as we begin to do it a little scrap, she goes and
does something that makes us mad again, so
it's no use to try."</p>

<p>"But she does talk just like the lady who
came to our house," persisted Jennie.</p>

<p>"You can see her if you have a mind to,"
said Maggie, "and then you'll know it is not
her. Come and look over the balusters, but
don't let her see you, or else she'll say, 'What
are you staring at, child?'"</p>

<p>They both ran to the head of the stairs,
where Jennie peeped over the balusters.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> her!" she whispered to Maggie. "I
am just as sure, as sure. She is all dressed
up nice to-day, and the other day she had on
an old water-proof cloak, and a great big umbrella,
and she didn't look so nice. But she's
the very same."</p>

<p>"Let's go down and tell mamma, and see
what she says," said Maggie, as the front-door
closed after Aunt Patty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<p>Away they both rushed to the parlor; but
when Jennie saw the ladies, she was rather
abashed and hung back a little, while Maggie
broke forth with, "Mamma, I have the greatest
piece of astonishment to tell you, you ever
heard. Jennie says she is quite sure Aunt
Patty is the woman who put the money in the
Bible and paid Dr. Dawson. But, mamma, it
can't be; can it? Aunt Patty is quite too dog-in-the-mangery;
is she not?"</p>

<p>"Maggie, dear," said her mother, "that is
not a proper way for you to speak of your
aunt, nor do I think it is just as you say.
What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"Why, mamma, you know the dog in the
manger could not eat the hay himself, and
would not let the oxen eat it; and Aunt
Patty would not buy the grove, or tell papa
what was the reason; so was she not like the
dog in the manger?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Mrs. Bradford, smiling
at Maggie's reasoning. "The two cases are
not at all alike. As you say, the dog would
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
not let the hungry oxen eat the hay he could
not use himself, but because Aunt Patty did
not choose to buy the grove, we have no right
to suppose she would not make, or has not
made some other good use of her money,
and if she chooses to keep that a secret, she
has a right to do so. No, I do not think
we can call her like the dog in the manger,
Maggie."</p>

<p>"But do you believe she gave up the grove
for that, mamma? She would not be so good
and generous; would she?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, I think she would. Aunt Patty
is a very generous-hearted woman, although
her way of doing things may be very different
from that of some other people. Mind,
I did not say that she <i>did</i> do this, but Willie
and Jennie both seem to be quite positive that
she is the old lady who was at their house,
and I think it is not at all unlikely."</p>

<p>"And shall you ask her, mamma?"</p>

<p>"No. If it was Aunt Patty who has been
so kind, she has shown very plainly that she
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
did not wish to be questioned, and I shall say
nothing, nor must you. We will not talk
about it any more now. We will wind up
the musical box, and let Willie see if he
likes it as well as the piano."</p>

<p class="pmb3">Very soon after this, Mrs. Granby came for
Willie and Jennie, and no sooner were they
outside of the door than they told of the
wonderful discovery they had made. Mrs.
Granby said she was not at all astonished,
"one might have been sure such a good turn
came out of <i>that</i> house, somehow."</p>

</span>
illie seemed amazingly cheered up
and amused by his visit, and told
eagerly of all he had heard and noticed,
with a gay ring in his voice which delighted
his mother. It was not so with Jennie,
although she had come home with her hands
full of toys and picture-books, the gifts of
the kind little girls she had been to see. She
seemed dull, and her mother thought she was
tired of play and the excitement of seeing so
much that was new and strange to her. But
Mrs. Richards soon found it was worse than
this.</p>

<p>"I don't see why I can't keep this frock
on," said Jennie, fretfully, as Mrs. Granby
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
began to unfasten her dress, which was kept
for Sundays and holidays.</p>

<p>"Surely, you don't want to go knocking
round here, playing and working in your best
frock!" said Mrs. Granby. "What would it
look like?"</p>

<p>"The other one is torn," answered Jennie,
pouting, and twisting herself out of Mrs.
Granby's hold.</p>

<p>"Didn't I mend it as nice as a new pin?"
said Mrs. Granby, showing a patch nicely put
in during Jennie's absence.</p>

<p>"It's all faded and ugly," grumbled Jennie.
"I don't see why I can't be dressed as
nice as other folks."</p>

<p>"That means you want to be dressed like
little Miss Bradfords," answered Mrs. Granby.
"And the reason why you ain't is because
your folks can't afford it, my dearie. Don't
you think your mother and me would like to
see you rigged out like them, if we had the
way to do it? To be sure we would. But
you see we can't do more than keep you
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
clean and whole; so there's no use wishin'."</p>

<p>Jennie said no more, but submitted to have
the old dress put on; but the pleasant look
did not come back to her face.</p>

<p>Anything like sulkiness or ill-temper from
Jennie was so unusual that the other children
listened in surprise; but her mother saw very
plainly what was the matter, and hoping it
would wear off, thought it best to take no
notice of it at present.</p>

<p>The dress fastened, Jennie went slowly and
unwillingly about her task of putting away
her own and her brother's clothes; not doing
so in her usual neat and orderly manner but
folding them carelessly and tumbling them
into the drawers in a very heedless fashion.
Mrs. Granby saw this, but she, too, let it pass,
thinking she would put things to rights when
Jennie was in bed.</p>

<p>Pretty soon Tommy came to Mrs. Granby
with some long story told in the curious jargon
of which she could not understand one word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>

<p>"What does he say, Jennie?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Jennie, crossly.
"I sha'n't be troubled to talk for him all the
time. He is big enough to talk for himself,
and he just may do it."</p>

<p>"Jennie, Jennie," said her mother, in a
grieved tone.</p>

<p>Jennie began to cry.</p>

<p>"Come here," said Mrs. Richards, thinking
a little soothing would be better than fault-finding.
"The baby is asleep; come and fix
the cradle so I can put her in it."</p>

<p>The cradle was Jennie's especial charge,
and she never suffered any one else to arrange
it; but now she pulled the clothes and pillows
about as if they had done something to offend
her.</p>

<p>"Our baby is just as good as Mrs. Bradford's,"
she muttered, as her mother laid the
infant in the cradle.</p>

<p>"I guess we think she is the nicest baby going,"
said Mrs. Richards, cheerfully; "and
it's likely Mrs. Bradford thinks the same of
hers."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't see why Mrs. Bradford's baby has
to have a better cradle than ours," muttered
Jennie. "Hers is all white muslin and pink,
fixed up so pretty, and ours is old and
shabby."</p>

<p>"And I don't believe Mrs. Bradford's baby
has a quilt made for her by her own little sister,"
answered the mother.</p>

<p>"And it has such pretty frocks, all work
and tucks and nice ribbons," said Jennie, determined
not to be coaxed out of her envy
and ill-humor, "and our baby has to do with
just a plain old slip with not a bit of trimming.
'Taint fair; it's real mean!"</p>

<p>"Jennie, Jennie," said her mother again,
"I am sorry I let you go, if it was only to
come home envious and jealous after the
pretty things you've seen."</p>

<p>"But haven't we just as good a right to have
them as anybody else?" sobbed Jennie, with
her head in her mother's lap.</p>

<p>"Not since the Lord has not seen fit to give
them to us," answered Mrs. Richards. "We
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
haven't a right to anything. All he gives us
is of his goodness; nor have we a <i>right</i> to fret
because he has made other folks better off
than us. All the good things and riches are
his to do with as he sees best; and if one has
a larger portion than another, he has his own
reasons for it, which is not for us to quarrel
with. And of all others, I wouldn't have you
envious of Mrs. Bradford's family that have
done so much for us."</p>

<p>"Yes," put in Mrs. Granby, with her
cheery voice; "them's the ones that ought to
be rich that don't spend all their money on
themselves, that makes it do for the comfort
of others that's not as well off, and for the
glory of Him that gives it. Now, if it had
been you or me, Jennie, that had so much
given to us, maybe we'd have been selfish
and stingy like; so the Lord saw it wasn't
best for us."</p>

<p>"I don't think anything could have made
you selfish or stingy, Janet Granby," said Mrs.
Richards, looking gratefully at her friend.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
"It is a small share of this world's goods that
has fallen to you, but your neighbors get the
best of what does come to you."</p>

<p>"Then there's some other reason why it
wouldn't be good for me," said Mrs. Granby;
"I'm safe in believin' that, and it ain't goin'
to do for us to be frettin' and pinin' after
what we haven't got, when the Almighty has
just been heapin' so much on us. And talkin'
of that, Jennie, you wipe your eyes, honey,
and come along to the kitchen with me;
there's a basket Mrs. Bradford gave me to unpack.
She said it had some few things for
Willie, to strengthen him up a bit before his
eyes were done. And don't let the father
come in and find you in the dumps; that
would never do. So cheer up and come
along till we see what we can find."</p>

<p>Jennie raised her head, wiped her eyes, and
followed Mrs. Granby, who, good, trusting soul,
soon talked her into good-humor and content
again.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Maggie and Bessie were very
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
full of the wonderful discovery of the afternoon,
and could scarcely be satisfied without
asking Aunt Patty if it could really be she
who had been to the policeman's house and
carried the money to pay his debts; also,
paid Dr. Dawson for the operation on Willie's
eyes. But as mamma had forbidden this, and
told them that they were not to speak of it
to others, they were obliged to be content with
talking of it between themselves. If it were
actually Aunt Patty who had done this, they
should look upon her with very new feelings.
They had heard from others that she could do
very generous and noble actions; but it was
one thing to hear of them, as if they were
some half-forgotten story of the past, and another
to see them done before their very eyes.
Aunt Patty was not rich. What she gave to
others, she must deny to herself, and they
knew this must have cost her a great deal.
She had given up the grove, on which she
had set her heart, that she might be able to
help the family in whom they were so
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
interested,&mdash;people of whom she knew nothing but
what she had heard from them. If she had
really been so generous, so self-sacrificing,
they thought they could forgive almost any
amount of crossness and meddling.</p>

<p>"For, after all, they're only the corners,"
said Maggie, "and maybe when she tried to
bear the policeman's burden, and felt bad about
the grove, that made her burden heavier, and
so squeezed out her corners a little more, and
they scratched her neighbors, who ought not
to mind if that was the reason. But I do
wish we could really know; don't you, Bessie?"</p>

<p>Putting all things together, there did not
seem much reason to doubt it. The policeman's
children were positive that Mrs. Lawrence
was the very lady who had been to their
house, and Aunt Patty had been out on two
successive days at such hours as answered to
the time when the mysterious old lady had
visited first them, and then Dr. Dawson.</p>

<p>Papa and Uncle Ruthven came home on
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
the evening of the next day, having made
arrangements that satisfied every one for
the summer among the mountains. Porter's
house, with its addition and new conveniences,
was just the place for the party, and
would even afford two or three extra rooms,
in case their friends from Riverside wished to
join them. The children were delighted as
their father spoke of the wide, roomy old hall,
where they might play on a rainy day, of the
spacious, comfortable rooms and long piazza;
as he told how beautiful the lake looked even
in this early spring weather, and of the grand
old rocks and thick woods which would soon
be covered with their green summer dress.
Still Bessie gave a little sigh after her beloved
sea. The old homestead and Aunt Patty's
cottage were about four miles from the lake,
just a pleasant afternoon's drive; and at the
homestead itself, where lived Mr. Bradford's
cousin, the two gentlemen had passed the
night. Cousin Alexander had been very glad
to hear that his relations were coming to pass
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
the summer at Chalecoo Lake, and his four
boys promised themselves all manner of pleasure
in showing their city cousins the wonders
of the neighborhood.</p>

<p>"It all looks just as it used to when I was
a boy," said Mr. Bradford. "There is no
change in the place, only in the people." He
said it with a half-sigh, but the children did
not notice it as they pleased themselves with
the thought of going over the old place where
papa had lived when he was a boy.</p>

<p>"I went to the spot where the old barn was
burned down, Aunt Patty," he said. "No
signs of the ruins are to be seen, as you know;
but as I stood there, the whole scene came
back to me as freshly as if it had happened
yesterday;" and he extended his hand to
Aunt Patty as he spoke.</p>

<p>The old lady laid her own within his, and
the grasp he gave it told her that years and
change had not done away with the grateful
memory of her long past services. She was
pleased and touched, and being in such a
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
mood, did not hesitate to express the pleasure
she, too, felt at the thought of having them all
near her for some months.</p>

<p>About half-way between the homestead and
the Lake House, Mr. Bradford and Mr. Stanton
had found board for Mrs. Richards and her
boy. It was at the house of an old farmer
who well remembered Mr. Bradford, and who
said he was pleased to do anything to oblige
him, though the gentlemen thought that the
old man was quite as well satisfied with the
idea of the eight dollars a week he had
promised in payment. And this was to come
from Maggie's and Bessie's store, which had
been carefully left in mamma's hand till
such time as it should be needed. All this
was most satisfactory to our little girls; and
when it should be known that the operation
on Willie's eyes had been successful, they
were to go to Mrs. Richards and tell her what
had been done for her boy's farther good.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bradford told her husband that night
of all that had taken place during his absence,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
and he quite agreed with her that it was without
doubt Aunt Patty herself who had been
the policeman's benefactor.</p>

<p>"I am not at all surprised," he said,
"though I own that this did not occur to me,
even when Richards described the old lady.
It is just like Aunt Patty to do a thing in
this way; and her very secrecy and her unwillingness
to confess why she would not
have the grove, or what she intended to do
with the money, convinced me that she was
sacrificing herself for the good of some other
person or persons."</p>

<p>Then Mr. Bradford told his wife that Aunt
Patty meant to go home in about ten days,
and should Willie's sight be restored before
she went, he hoped to be able to persuade her
to confess that she had had a share in bringing
about this great happiness. He was very
anxious that his children should be quite certain
of this, as he thought it would go far
to destroy their old prejudice, and to cause
kind feelings and respect to take the place of
their former fear and dislike.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Bradford said that good had been done
already by the thought that it was probably
Aunt Patty who had been so generous, and
that the little ones were now quite as ready to
believe all that was kind and pleasant of the
old lady as they had been to believe all that
was bad but two days since. She told how
they had come to her that morning, Maggie
saying, "Mamma, Bessie and I wish to give
Aunt Patty something to show we have more
approval of her than we used to have; so I
am going to make a needle-book and Bessie a
pin-cushion, and put them in her work-basket
without saying anything about them."</p>

<p>They had been very busy all the morning
contriving and putting together their little
gifts without any help from older people, and
when they were finished, had placed them in
Aunt Patty's basket, hanging around in order
to enjoy her surprise and pleasure when she
should find them there.</p>

<p>But the poor little things were disappointed,
they could scarcely tell why. If it had been
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
mamma or Aunt Bessie who had received
their presents, there would have been a great
time when they were discovered. There would
have been exclamations of admiration and delight
and much wondering as to who could
have placed them there,&mdash;"some good fairy
perhaps who knew that these were the very
things that were wanted," and such speeches,
all of which Maggie and Bessie would have enjoyed
highly, and at last it would be asked if
they could possibly have made them, and
then would have come thanks and kisses.</p>

<p>But nothing of this kind came from Aunt
Patty. She could not enter into other people's
feelings so easily as those who had been
unselfish and thoughtful for others all their
lives; and though she was much gratified by
these little tokens from the children, she did
not show half the pleasure she felt; perhaps
she really did not know how. True she thanked
them, and said she should keep the needle-book
and pin-cushion as long as she lived; but
she expressed no surprise, and did not praise
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
the work with which they had taken so much
pains.</p>

<p>"What is this trash in my basket?" she
said, when she discovered them. "Children,
here are some of your baby-rags."</p>

<p>"Aunt Patty," said Mrs. Bradford, quickly,
"they are intended for you; the children have
been at work over them all the morning."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Mrs. Lawrence, changing her
tone. "I did not understand. I am sure I
thank you very much, my dears; and when
you come to see me this summer, I shall show
you how to do far better than this. I have a
quantity of scraps and trimmings of all kinds,
of which you can make very pretty things."</p>

<p>This was intended to be kind; but the
promise for the future did not make up for
the disappointment of the present; and the
children turned from her with a feeling that
their pains had been almost thrown away.</p>

<p>"Mamma," Bessie had said afterwards, "do
you think Aunt Patty was very grateful for
our presents?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, dear, I think she was," said mamma,
"and I think she meant to show it in her own
way."</p>

<p>"But, mamma, do you think that was a
nice way? You would not have said that to
any one, and I felt as if I wanted to cry a
little."</p>

<p>Mamma had seen that her darlings were
both hurt, and she felt very sorry for them,
but she thought it best to make light of it, so
said, cheerfully, "I am quite sure Aunt Patty
was gratified, pussy, and that whenever she
looks at your presents, she will think with pleasure
of the kind little hands that made them."</p>

<p>"When I am big, and some one gives me
something I have pleasure in, I'll try to show
the pleasure in a nice way," said Maggie.</p>

<p>"Then you must not forget to do it while
you are young," said mamma. "Let this
show you how necessary it is to learn pleasant
habits of speaking and acting while you are
young."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Maggie, with a long sigh, "and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
Aunt Patty ought to be excused. I suppose,
since she was not brought up in the way
she should go when she was young, she ought
to be expected to depart from it when she is
old. We must just make the best of it when
she don't know any better, and take example
of her."</p>

<p>"Yes," said mamma, rather amused at the
way in which Maggie had put into words the
very thought that was in her own mind; "let
us make the best of everything, and be always
ready to believe the best of those about us."</p>

<p>All this Mrs. Bradford told to her husband,
and agreed with him that it was better not to
endeavor to find out anything more till the
trial on Willie's eyes was over.</p>

<p>Maggie's new volume of "The Complete
Family" was begun the next day in these
words: "Once there was a man who lived in
his home in the mountains, and who always
listened very modestly to everything that was
said to him, so his wife used to say a great
deal to him. And one day she said, 'My
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
dear, Mr. and Mrs. Happy, with all their family,
and a great lot of their best friends, are
coming to live with us this summer, and they
are used to having a very nice time, so we
must do all we can to make them comfortable,
or maybe they will say, "Pooh, this is
not a nice place at all. Let us go to the sea
again. These are very horrid people!"' And
the man said, 'By all means, my dear; and
we will give them all they want, and let them
look at the mountains just as much as they
choose. But I do not think they will say unkind
words even if you are a little disagreeable,
but will make the best of you, and think
you can't help it.' Which was quite true, for
M. Happy and B. Happy had a good lesson
the man did not know about, and had made a
mistake; and sometimes when people seem
dreadfully hateful, they are very nice,&mdash;I
mean very good,&mdash;so it's not of great consequence
if they are not so nice as some people,
and they ought not to be judged, for maybe
they have a burden. And M. Happy made
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
two mistakes; one about Mrs. Jones, and the
other about that other one mamma don't want
me to write about. So this book will be about
how they went to the mountains and had a
lovely time. I guess we will."</p>

<p>Rather more than a week had gone by.
Willie Richards lay on his bed in a darkened
room, languid and weak, his eyes bandaged,
his face paler than ever, but still cheerful and
patient. It was five days since the operation
had been performed, but Willie had not yet
seen the light, nor was it certain that he
would ever do so, though the doctor hoped
and believed that all had gone well. They
had given the boy chloroform at the time, and
then bound his eyes before he had recovered
his senses. But on this day the bandage was
to be taken off for the first, and then they
should know. His mother sat beside him
holding his thin, worn hand in hers.</p>

<p>"Willie," she said, "the doctor is to be
here presently, and he will take the bandage
from your eyes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>

<p>"And will I see then, mother?"</p>

<p>"If God pleases, dear. But, Willie, if he
does not see fit to give you back your sight,
could you bear it, and try to think that it is
his will, and he knows best?"</p>

<p>Willie drew a long, heavy breath, and was
silent a moment, grasping his mother's fingers
till the pressure almost pained her; then he
said, low, and with a quiver in his voice, "I
would try, mother; but it would be 'most too
hard after all. If it could be just for a little
while, just so I could see your dear face for a
few moments, then I would try to say, 'Thy
will be done.'"</p>

<p>"However it is, we must say that, my boy;
but, please the Lord, we shall yet praise him
for his great goodness in giving you back
your poor, dear eyes."</p>

<p>As she spoke, the door opened, and her husband
put his head in.</p>

<p>"Here's the doctor, Mary," he said, with a
voice that shook, in spite of his efforts to keep
it steady; and then he came in, followed by
the doctor and Mrs. Granby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<p>The latter, by the doctor's orders, opened
the window so as to let in a little softened
light, and after a few cheerful words the doctor
unfastened the bandage, and uncovered
the long sightless eyes. Willie was resting in
his mother's arms with his head back against
her shoulder, and she knew that he had
turned it so that her face might be the first
object his eyes rested on.</p>

<p>It was done; and, with a little glad cry, the
boy threw up his arms about his mother's
neck.</p>

<p>"What is it, Willie?" asked his father,
scarcely daring to trust his voice to speak.</p>

<p>"I saw it! I saw it!" said the boy.</p>

<p>"Saw what, sonny?" asked his father,
wishing to be sure that the child could really
distinguish objects.</p>

<p>"I saw mother's face, her dear, dear face;
and I see you, too, father. Oh, God is so
good! I will be such a good boy all my life.
Oh, will I never have to fret to see mother's
face again?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ahem!" said the doctor, turning to a
table and beginning to measure some drops
into a glass, while Mrs. Granby stood crying
for joy at the other end of the room. "If
you're not to, you must keep more quiet than
this, my boy; it will not do for you to grow
excited. Here, take this."</p>

<p>"Who's that?" asked Willie, as the strange
face met his gaze.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" said the doctor. "Are you going
to lose your ears now you have found
your eyes? I thought you knew all our
voices, my fine fellow."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Willie, "I know now;
it's the doctor. Doctor, was I just as patient
as you wanted me to be?"</p>

<p>"First-rate," answered the doctor; "but
you must have a little more patience yet. I'll
leave the bandage off, but we will not have
quite so much light just now, Mrs. Granby."</p>

<p>Willie begged for one look at Auntie
Granby, and then Jennie was called, that he
might have a peep at her, after which he was
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
content to take the medicine and lie down,
still holding his mother's hand, and now and
then putting up his fingers with a wistful
smile to touch the dearly loved face he could
still see bending over him in the dim light.</p>

<p>That evening the policeman went up to
Mr. Bradford's. He was asked to walk into
the parlor, where sat Mr. Bradford and Aunt
Patty, while old nurse was just taking Maggie
and Bessie off to bed.</p>

<p>"Oh, here is our policeman!" said Bessie;
and she ran up to him, holding out her hand.
"How is your Willie?"</p>

<p>"That's just what I came to tell you, dear.
I made bold to step up and let you know
about Willie, sir," he said, turning to Mr.
Bradford.</p>

<p>"And what is the news?" asked the gentleman.</p>

<p>"The best, sir. The Lord has crowned all
his mercies to us by giving us back our boy's
sight."</p>

<p>"And has Willie seen his mother's face?"
asked Bessie, eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, that he has. He took care that
should be the first thing his eyes opened on;
and it just seems as if he could not get his
full of looking at it. He always was a mother
boy, my Willie, but more than ever so since
his blindness."</p>

<p>"How is he?" asked Mr. Bradford.</p>

<p>"Doing nicely, sir. Rather weakish yet;
but when he can bear the light, and get out
into the fresh air, it will do him good; and I
hope he'll come round after a spell, now that
his mind is at ease, and he's had a sight of
that he'd set his heart on, even if we can't
just follow out the doctor's orders."</p>

<p>Bessie felt as if she could keep her secret
no longer. "May I, papa,&mdash;may I?" she
asked.</p>

<p>Papa understood her, and nodded assent.</p>

<p>"But you <i>can</i> follow the doctor's orders,"
said she, turning again to the policeman, "and
Willie can have all the fresh air he needs,&mdash;fresh
mountain air, he and his mother. And
Maggie and I are to pay it out of the money
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
that Uncle Ruthven gave us for the eye doctor
whom the"&mdash;here Bessie looked half doubtfully
towards Aunt Patty&mdash;"the old lady
paid. And now, you see, it's a great deal
nicer, 'cause if she hadn't, then, maybe, Willie
couldn't go to the country."</p>

<p>Bessie talked so fast that Richards did not
understand at first, and her father had to explain.
The man was quite overcome.</p>

<p>"It's too much, sir, it's too much," he
said, in a husky voice, twisting his cap round
and round in his hands. "It was the last
thing was wanting, and I feel as if I had nothing
to say. There ain't no words to tell what
I feel. I can only say may the Lord bless you
and yours, and grant you all your desires in
such measure as he has done to me."</p>

<p>Mr. Bradford then told what arrangements
had been made, in order to give Richards time
to recover himself. The policeman thought
all these delightful, and said he knew his wife
and boy would feel that they could never be
thankful and happy enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span></p>

<p>"And to think that all this has come out of
that little one being brought up to the station
that day, sir; it's past belief almost," he said.</p>

<p>"So good has been brought out of evil,"
said Mr. Bradford.</p>

<p>As soon as the policeman had gone, Maggie
and Bessie ran up-stairs to tell their mother
the good news, leaving papa and Aunt Patty
alone together. Mr. Bradford then turned to
the old lady, and laying his hand gently on
her shoulder, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Aunt Patty, you have laid up your treasure
where moth and rust do not corrupt; but
surely it is bearing interest on earth."</p>

<p>"How? Why? What do you mean,
Henry?" said Mrs. Lawrence, with a little
start.</p>

<p>"Come, confess, Aunt Patty," he said;
"acknowledge that it is to you this good fellow
who has just left us owes his freedom
from debt, his child's eyesight, his release
from cares which were almost too much
even for his hopeful spirit; acknowledge
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
that you have generously sacrificed a long-cherished
desire, given up the fruits of much
saving and self-denial, to make those happy in
whom you could have had no interest save as
creatures and children of one common Father.
We all know it. The policeman's children
recognized you, and told my little ones. Why
will you not openly share with us the pleasure
we must all feel at the blind boy's restoration
to sight? Did you not see dear Bessie's wistful
look at you as she bade you good-night?
These little ones cannot understand why there
should be any reason to hide such kindness as
you have shown to these people, or why you
should refuse to show an interest you really
feel. It is true that we are told not to let our
left hand, know that which is done by our
right hand; but are we not also commanded
so to let our light shine before men that they
may see our good works and glorify our Father
in heaven? And can we do so, or truly
show our love to him, if we hide the services
rendered for his sake behind a mask of coldness
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
and reserve? My dear aunt, for his
sake, for your own, for the sake of the affection
and confidence which I wish my children
to feel for you, and which I believe you wish
to gain, let me satisfy them that it was really
you who did this thing."</p>

<p>The old lady hesitated for a moment longer,
and then she broke down in a burst of humility
and penitence such as Mr. Bradford had
never expected to see from her. She told him
how she had heard them all talking of the policeman
and his troubles, and how much she
had wished that she was able to help him;
how she had thought that the desire to have
the grove was only a fancy, right in itself perhaps,
but not to be indulged if she could better
spend the money for the good of others;
and how, without taking much time to consider
the matter, she had decided to give it up.
Then she had half regretted it, but would not
confess to herself or others that she did so, and
so, feeling irritable and not at ease with herself,
had been impatient and angry at the least
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
thing which seemed to oppose her plans. The
children, she said, had shamed her by their
greater patience and submission under the
disappointment she had so unintentionally
brought upon them, and now she felt that the
ill-temper she had shown had brought reproach
on the Master whom she really wished
to serve, and destroyed the little influence she
had been able to gain with the children.</p>

<p>Mr. Bradford told her he thought she was
mistaken here, and if the children could only
be quite certain that it was she who had
proved such a good friend to the policeman's
family, they would forget all else in their
pleasure at her kindness and sympathy.</p>

<p>So Mrs. Lawrence told him to do as he
thought best; and she found it was as he said;
for when Maggie and Bessie came down in the
morning, full of joy at the happiness which
had come to Willie and his parents, they ran
at once to Aunt Patty, and Bessie, putting
her little arms about her neck, whispered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear Aunt Patty, we're so much obliged
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
to you about Willie, and if we had only
known it was you, we wouldn't have felt so
bad about it. Now we only feel glad, and
don't you feel glad, too, when you know how
happy they all are?"</p>

<p>Then Maggie sidled up, and slipping her
hand into Aunt Patty's, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Aunt Patty, please to forgive me for saying
naughty things about you when I didn't
know you was the queer old lady."</p>

<p>Aunt Patty was quite ready to exchange
forgiveness; and for the two remaining days
of her stay, it seemed as if her little nieces
could not do enough to show how pleased and
grateful they were; and when she left them,
they could tell her with truth how glad they
were that they were to see her soon again in
her own home.</p>

<p class="pmb3 pmb2">And if you are not tired of Maggie and
Bessie, you may some time learn how they
spent their summer among the mountains.</p>
